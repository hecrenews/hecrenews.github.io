The year 1804. The President is mad-lad Thomas Jefferson. Reduced the Navy to uphold his beliefs of a weaker central government.
Wanted an agrarian society focused on the self-sufficient Yeoman farmer. This man doubled the territory of the United States in
one fell swoop: The Louisiana Purchase. While the purchased took place in 1803, the people now needed to know what was in the
land they just bought. In comes frontiersmen Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, a daring duo who were ready to explore the
vast new area.

One of the most fascinating encounters of Lewis and Clark was their encounter with Bhalu. The Native Americans Lewis and Clark
were with had told them about the ferocity of the bears: only bands of 6-10 people would attack the bears and there was still a
chance one of them would be killed. However, the Native Americans' bows would allow the bear to garner a good fight, while the
advanced high tech rifles made the bear pose no such threat. Lewis and Clark go on to describe the creatures.

"[A] most remendous looking animal, and extreemly hard to kill"

- Merriwether Lewis

"[A] verry large and a turrible looking animal"

- William Clark

Ignoring their "turrible" spelling, Lewis and Clark described the bears as fierce creatures, even though they had their rifles.
Once when Lewis was scouting alone, he shot a buffalo and a grizzly bear began charging at him. Lewis' rifle was not reloaded
and was not ready to be fired. The bear was fast approaching. In the open field, the only protection was a river. Lewis went
into the water and the bear suddenly turned back and ran away. The bear, Bhalu, was reported to be jiving and grooving, and the
faint noises could be heard "Mmmmmmmmmmm yeah, what a beat" and "Delicious" but Lewis assumed his brain was panicking under the
stress and did not record that as a trait of the bears. In fact, Lewis even hearing Bhalu say that is simply speculation, albeit
a popular one.

The bears were proving to be a fearsome challenge. Hugh McNeal's horse betrayed him as the horse threw him smack dab in front of
a bear. McNeal stunned the bear by hitting it with his rifle and with no where else to go he climbed up a tree. Bears are big
and mighty but they cannot climb trees. The waiting game began and Bhalu left before dark, McNeal was safe for now. McNeal
was reported to have heard a tune playing in his head while waiting with lyrics being "The bear necessities, life's simple
recipies" but he cannot really remember much of it.

Bears are fascinating creatures and hold deep symbolic meaning. The old days of frontier and exploration are long gone, but the
expedition of Lewis and Clark gives us a wide view into the natural America and what it could have been like if it was not
touched by humans.

EDIT: After speaking to a bear expert, bears are actually very good at climbing trees. McNeal was quite lucky that day!
