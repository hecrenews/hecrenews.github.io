This is a pretty good article as well.
[Hector made a nice article about another article](https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/20/super-cool-article-part-1-of-3.html) but since he's taking
a while to upload and because I ran out of ideas I'm gonna steal his series and hop on the train. This is a pretty cool article and we only have one more left, can
you guess what it is? I would like to write more but I already wrote a whole article's worth of content, I'll let you be this time around. This has been Mister Mjir,
popping in and now popping out.
