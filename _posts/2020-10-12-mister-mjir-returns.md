After spending about a month doing time-travelling shenanigans, Mister Mjir finally returns back to the present. Additionally, history has been rewritten and
the revered daily article streak has returned! (Although it seems some corners were cut to maintain that streak).

Wait a second, this article is about me so I'll just write it in first person.

So first there are some rumors going on about the letter of the day containing some secret message if you read all of them in order, but this is nonsense. There
is no meaning to the letter of the day, I literally just google a random number generator and then toss that letter of the alphabet into the article and call it a
day. It's a surefire way to ensure I don't lose that intimidating streak, so please stop asking about it, the emails are (not) overflowing.

Also many people must be wondering "what time travelling is like" or "what happened to Bulstrode." First of all, if you are not acquainted with Bulstrode I suggest
you check out the Hecrenews' search feature to get up to speed. I basically left his super-secret top-secret labratory and returned to my good ol' pals Wopps Minor,
Banana the Human, the new guy (although not so new these days) Hector, and my not so good ol' pal the boss, who is wondering where I've been but can't disagree with
the results. So as for what time travelling is like it feels pretty normal. Sometimes weeks and days pass but it only feels like a few seconds in the machine. It
really doesn't feel anything special, the concept itself is pretty cool but doing it makes it less cool. Now some of you may be wondering about all the paradoxes
and dangers of times travelling, but our avid readers know Bulstrode already addressed this. The website is too lazy to update just because history was rewritten
by time travelers, so the article about me losing my streak will still exist even though the streak was never lost.

I'm excited to get back into the Hecrenews flow, we are the number 1 news source in the Hecresphere after all! In other news that rival news site we were talking
about is in such a state the boss is probably gonna call of the war because it would be pitiful to see them fight back. I don't even know why we need to wage
war with other news sites but if the boss says you gotta do it you gotta do it, catch my drift?

Also if the Hecrenews isn't enough HBA content to satisfy you, make sure to check out the Hecrenet! This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out!
