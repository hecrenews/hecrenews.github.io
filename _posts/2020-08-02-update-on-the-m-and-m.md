A leaked meeting was revealed to the HBA team involving the progress on the M&M, and it is good news! The HBA was planning to finish the book before the next school
year began, but had so far made no progress on the book. In the leaked meeting, we discovered that the M&M has already finished phase 1 out of 2 of their planning, with
phase 2 planning on being finished today. Soon the HBA will start writing the book, and they will definetely get it finished by the school year start (they say).

If you are behind and confused on this M&M business, I highly recommend checking out this
[great article](https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/04/hba-book.html) written by the Hecrenews explaining what it is. We don't know what it's about yet,
but we are sure it's going to change literature as we know it. Book are too boring for most people, and the HBA is striving to make the M&M a book anyone, even the
book haters, will read. We can only hope they are not rushing it, as that will dillute the quality we are so hoping for. With the HBA's expections for the book to
change modern literature as it stands, every character in the book musy be immaculate.

The M&M is going to be an enjoyable book on the surface level but by analyzing it or just giving thought to it when reading, there is a whole layer of depth hidden
between the lines. A lot of deep questions about the human nature as well as reavling the human nature and battling ideals. There are going to be many themes, and
there are many events happening at the small and big picture scale.

Anywho there's not that much that happened, but it's cool to see the HBA actually start writing the book now that they have procrastinated and can begin the grind.

In other news (yes a double feature) we will be pausing upgrades to the Hecrenews. We have settled with the current design plans as we haven't recieved many suggestions,
we will still take your suggestions and implement them, we just can't spend the scarce energy required to do it ourselves. The homescreen is tailored for mobile,
small screens, and big computer screens. Our search feature now allows you to search by tags so you can quickly find articles you're interested in.

Guess that's it for me, spread the Hecrenews today and say 'Good Day' to the HBA!
