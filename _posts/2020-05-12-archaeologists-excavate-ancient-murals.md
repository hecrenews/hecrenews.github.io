Recently a famous archaeologist group (of whose name is unknown) recently excavated ancient murals from 5000 B.C. The team was
very careful in ensuring they did not damage any of the murals, as they were highly fragile.

"Ya know it's oua job to dig up these fossils and things, its pretty cool. Get ya hands dirty and find cool rocks."

Archaeologists are able to teach us about the culture and history of our world. Their work is invaluable to history teachers as
it gives them more homework to give to their students. These murals express the human nature and are rooted in deep symbolism.
The archaeologists have also taken the liberties to colorize the pictures to make them even more realistsic. Here are the photos.
