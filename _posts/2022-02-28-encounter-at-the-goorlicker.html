You may remember Wah Turtistin from [a few articles back](https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/10/07/alarming-nearby-water-sources-reach-near-boiling-levels.html). In fact, you should remember Turtistin from a few articles back!! Did you forget? Then there is a chance you are not a loyal reader, shame. Anywho, Turtistin is back at it again testing the mighty Goorlicker stream, and now he‚Äôs teamed up with our very own Sheeple Dumbell. They‚Äôre gonna make a great team, but I foresee the testing mostly being Donel teaching Turtistin how to use the equipment, the scientific method, and basic common knowledge. Dunnell brought his very own briefcase, and gave a pamphlet to Turtistin explaining the 10 levels of water testing. Actually, Donnell scribbled something on the pamphlet, and now there were 11 levels. Turtistin was in the newly added level 0, he had a long way to go before reaching the higher levels where he could use Sheeple Donalbain‚Äôs hand-crafted tools, vetted by all of SAR themselves.

The duo started with testing pH. It should have been easy, but Turtistin had a mad compulsion to drop everything into the water. Especially true with chemical substances, but pH strips seemed to work for Turtistin as well. After losing 12 pH strips to the Goorlicker, Duenell and Turtistin finally moved onto temperature. Coincidentially, they encountered my man, Isiah Dobrilla. If you don‚Äôt know Dobrilla, then you really must be living under a rock like that one starfish, I forgot his name. They chatted for some time, it seems Dobrilla is doing much better these days; the man is always part of something big. Dobrilla was just walking along the trail and enjoying the view of the mighty Goorlicker, and after the conversation he continued walking along.

After an excruciating two and a half hours, Donell and Turtistin finally finished one location- out of four. üòøüòøüòø. They went to spot number two, but as they pulled out the sulfuric acid they knew something was up. Some dark force was lurking behind them and lo and behold- it was Brian Jones!!! ‚ÄúI can recognize that tie-die shirt from miles away,‚Äù said Dunnel. Dunnell instructed Turtistin to fall back and take shelter, because Brian Jones can turn any normal person insane. Luckilly for our SAR lead, he knew a thing or two about science, so he had a sort of immunity. Brian jones carried with him a metal pole attached to a contraption, and once the clouds began to darken Donnell knew what was going down. ‚ÄúCurse those electrostatics!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need years of integration before you get to my level Sheeple,‚Äù remarked Jones. Lighting struck, and Sheeple was about to experience the last shock of his life, but then came along Mr. Dobrilla chasing a slipper floating in the Goorlicker. While the machine was supposed to shock Dunnell, the zzzzap was redirected to Dobrilla, who donned a metal ring. This was a ring given to him by the Nigerian Prince himself, and after being struck a very strange event occured.

The head of SAR, the altruistic Dobrilla, and the exiled Brian Jones all vanished. Turtistin just stood in shock. He was about to have a mental breakdown, but he steeled his nerves and continued the water testing, someone had to do it. Someone had to ensure the mighty Goorlicker was still alive and kicking. Turtistin surprisingly picked up the water testing fast; he reached level seven already by the time he was done with spot 3! Turtistin is setting up his future, and it‚Äôs a very inspirational message to all of our loyal readers. Sometimes we will lose the ones most important to us, but it is in these times one must stay strong and keep pushing towards tomorrow. Greatness can be achieved, and maybe you too can become a level 10 water tester!

Now what happened to the three who disappeared, where did they go? Who knows as it's a mystery for next time. The new boss pays better but I don't have the energy to investigat further.
This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.
