And with this we have finally concluded this super cool article series. Now I know, you just read an entire article and here I am spitting out more words. Do not
worry, I will try to keep this short. We started out with Hector talking about
[The](https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/20/super-cool-article-part-1-of-3.html), and then I stole the series from him and did
[A](https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/21/super-cool-article-part-2-of-3.html). Finally, here we have An. With the powers of these three articles
(the, a, and an) you should be able to flex on your English teacher and ace your sentence parts quizzes. Good luck to all of you out there, this has been Mister
Mjir, popping in and now popping out.
