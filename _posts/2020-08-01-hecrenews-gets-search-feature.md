Gotta finish this article fast fast fast! Don't wanna lose that daily streak now.

Hecrenews got lots of visual updates, looks epic now. Latest section looks so cool, but
we still need to update teh stuff below that, that's not looking that cool and we gotta make
it look super cool.

Anywho we finally got a search feature. Right now this is a very basic search feature,
there isn't that much you can do. Right now you can only serach up a specific tag,
and you gotta spell it right and capitalize it right.

That's literally it, I'm running out of time. Probably stay tuned for a much better search
feature tomorrow, bye folks!
