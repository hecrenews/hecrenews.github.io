Machu Picchu is a great place. It's one of the most iconic places in Peru! Just search up Peru in Google and go to images, and you will see pictures of the Incan
structures built long, long ago. The architecture of ancient civilization is amazing, and merits an article of its own! However, today we are going to be talking
about the Sacred Valley, the place where Machu Picchu is in. The Sacred Valley is in the Cusco region of Peru, here's a handy-dandy diagram:

Irrigated by the Urubamba River itself, our ancestors were able to use the area because of the rich soil. The Sacred Valley is a beautiful place, you'll even find
rainbow mountains there.

Now the Sacred Valley is an awesome place, and it brings in hundreds of thousands of tourists per year. If you are planning to visit the Sacred Valley in Peru, then
you should consider booking a cliff hotel. They are pods on the cliff of mountains, perfect for a quick retreat during a hike to Machu Picchu. First you will climb
up to the pods, either through iron rungs or via hiking. It is tough to get up there, but it is well worth the struggle. Not only are you rewarded with a glass of
wine but the view is absolutely astonishing! Seeing the Sacred Valley from the pods is a surreal experience which you will remember for the rest of your life. Your guide
will give you a belly-filling dinner, and you can stargaze all night long or until you sleep. What a great experience, I should go there again. At the end of your stay
you get to take a zip wire to get back down, isn't that great!

The Sacred Valley has an amazing view, stay tuned to hear a bit on the ruins of Machu Picchu itself!
