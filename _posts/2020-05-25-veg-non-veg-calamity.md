This is a message we are recieving from the Hecretary Bird (through omens of course).

The surge in non-vegetarians vs. vegetarians has grown to frightening concerns, and in our effort to stay the most reliable
news source in the Hecresphere we cannot take sides on this issue.

However, all of our authors (minus the great Hecretary Bird of course) have bias based on their diets, so stay wary when
reading their articles. We do not want to persuade you to take a side, and please do not take a side just because your
favorite author has chosen a diet.

During this calamity the HBA will be working its hardest to end the conflict. Please stay tight and stay calm.
We can assure you, with the HBA's help, everything will be fine. Trust in the HBA and the great Hecretary Bird.
