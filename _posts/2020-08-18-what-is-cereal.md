What is cereal? Is it a soup? Is it a salad? Are you supposed to put the milk in first or the ceral in first? This mysterious food item gets consumed by children
all across the world and many take it for granted. Few people actually know what it is. Today we will attempt to answer many of these questions, and we may not get
true confirmation until HAC or SAR reviews this article. Despite these hurdles I will attempt to do my best in determining the mystery of this trending breakfast item.

I guess to do this like how SAR would do it I would have to analyze some of the properties of salads and soup. First another distinction must be made: what is the
difference between a soup and a stew? Thankfully, unlike the SAR, I'm not a professional so I don't need to cite my sources and can use quick google searches to find
out juicy information. So the difference between a soup and a stew is the amount of liquid it contains. A soup is more "liquidy" or more watery than your local stew,
and you might additionally find more vegetables (or/and other ingredients like meat) in a stew than in soup, but this could vary. Something similar to a stew is a
curry, but a curry does not really mean anything as it's a general, very vague word describing various gravies and sauces used in foreign cuisine. Now we won't dive
to deep into sauces (I hope) but there is also gravy, but let's just go with gravy is a sauce for now. Sauces could be similar to soups/stews, but a sauce is a
seasoning, something you put on top of your meal. But here's the deal with this, sauces are usually heated up, boiled even with the solid food matter in them. So the
question is do you add warm milk to your cereal or do you heat up your cereal and milk on a stove or in a microwave?

How about a salad? A salad is a mixture of food. Sauces don't have 'liquids' per say but can contain sauces. So plain cereal is not a salad, because a salad needs to
have multiple food types in it. Some cereals decide to go the extra healthy route and include everyone's favourite, fruits! so if you eat your cereal without milk
and it has strawberries or blueberries then you might be looking at a salad. However, it may be a requirement to have a green substance in the salad. By substance I
am talking about something which is probably a leaf, lettuce being the most common one. By no means am I a salad, or even food expert, but when I think of salad I
picture lettuce. However, one cannot forget about the fruit salad! The fruit salad typically does not consist of a green leaf item, but it is still a salad. With
this definition, no milk cereal with some fruits (maybe even veggies if you're a madlad) might be considered to be a salad.

So far we have talked about multiple forms of cereal, but it is starting to get off topic. We need to ask the real big questions. Let's just focus on a standard cereal
(which was determined to be standard by a survery I asked SAR to conduct on the locals). A bowl, milk, and cereal. Yes, cereal is in cereal. Cereal will refer to
cereal as a whole and the other cereal refers to simply what you get in a ceral box. Super intuitive, I know, you can't have my autograph yet. To make this, one
must combine the bowl and cold milk from the fridge along with some cereal from the bag from the box. Did you heat it up? No, so it cannot be in the soup or stew
family. Is there a liquid? Yes, so it cannot be a salad. It seems there is only one conclusion to come to at this point. Your everyday cereal, is just cereal. Yep,
that's right. We just answered one of the biggest questions. I hope SAR (Hecrenews Science and Research) approves of this article.

Now the question remains? What do you put in first: the cereal or the milk? Some experts say it's the bowl but we will have to come back to it another day. This
has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.
