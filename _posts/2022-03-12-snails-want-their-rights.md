Deep in the depths of the Amazon one can find the creature known as a giant Amazonian river snail. In Peru we just call these churos. They're delicious when in a stew
and they're a great source of protein! These gastropods can grow up to six inches, and are found in Northeastern Peru and a few other select locations near the
Amazon river. Everyone loves a good churo stew, unless, you are the stew.

Recently snails have began a progressive movement where they are fighting for their rights. Representative Kash from the Snail Party has even flown into Peru to speak
to the masses. I was lucky enough to interview Kash! He was a busy man; all the papers were trying to get some words from him. However, after he heard I'm with the
Hecrenews he gleefully rejected the other reporters and arranged an interview with me. Here's what he has to say.

> "Snails have been disrespected for thousands of years. We're the main carriers of the worst parasites around, we're considered pests, and we have salt poured on us.
> We're a peaceful species, on that doesn't deserve such animosity.
> That's why I chose to become a representative of the Snail Party. We promote, above al lelse, recognition and rights for all snails."

Outstanding words from an official Snail Party representatives. Kash is hard at work gaining public support, working with legislators, and lobbying coporations to
advance the rights of snails. Some business owners (like our good old pal,
[Bule](https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/07/26/in-a-world-full-of-pants-man-struggles-to-find-pant.html)) are giving their full support to the snail party,
but convincing the bigger coporations poses a major challenge Kash and the Snail Party must overcome. One major issue the snails are tackling right now is the
consumption of snails. It is unethical, it is unhumane they say. It does harms the snails progress on their social reformation, because they kept on getting eaten. If
snails can prevent people from eating them, they will be able to make an astronomical amount of progress on their liberties.

The human world is very challenging for snails. Salt can easily knock snails down a peg. Salt absorbs water form the snail through their slimy exterior through osmosis,
and the snails soon die due to dehydration. The poor mollusks stand little chance! However, while snails are slimy, they generally do no harm to humans. Humans do
much more harm the snails. Take the giant Amazonian river snails for example. They peacefully reside in the jungle, and humans invade their home and pluck them for
consumption. Truly horrific.

However, I am not a politician, I am just a Hecrenews reporter from Peru. The final decision is for you, the loyal Hecrenews viewer, to make.
