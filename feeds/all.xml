    <description>An article about Timeless Watches</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a loyal Hecrenews reader, you may know that I’m no stranger to time, especially when time goes wild. No time slowing down or stopping or travel
this article though, today we’re going to be talking about a local businessman and his revolutionary business strategy/model. This entrepreneur is
gonna make it big, he’s gonna make it huge, I know it. Introducing Trist Wawch, a man who has revolutionized the watch industry. All the big brands are
in fear of going bankrupt because Wawch is able to do it all. On top of creating watches at all price points (dirt cheap to billionaire designer
models), Wawch has added his own special flair. A new technique to make his watches stand out from the rest. Timeless watches.</p>

<p>First of all, what even is a watch? Watch is a verb, it means to look at something. Or at least I think, that’s my own interpretation, now let’s check
out what google and the other big guys have to say. Alright, the folks at Oxford Languages have this to say abot watch, “look at or observe attentively 
over a period of time.” Well, I forgot the period of time bit, but otherwise I was spot on. There are a few other definitions, like to be careful,
but who needs those. Watch can also be a noun, but specifically we are talking about wrist watches. When did the first watch appear? Well, we need to
talk about when time itself appeared. While time was always moving around, right under our noses, we didn’t really have a standard for time. Some groups
of people use the sun for time. The sun usually aligns with our bodies’ natural rhythm. We are awake when the sun is up, and sleep when the sun is down.
At one point in time, lol, we started moving fast. We started moving so fast, that we could move from one place to another, and the sun would still be in relatively
the same position. How were we able to move so fast? Well, we didn’t gain an extra leg. We invented trains! With the advent of trains, we needed to standardize times,
it just made everything a whole lot easier. Then we built our lives around our standardized time, and wrist watches are a neat item you can just slap on to see what
time it is in a glance.</p>

<p>So, back to how Wawch is revolutionizing the watch industry. Timeless watches. When a watch is timeless, it loses its ability to tell time. Now, I was quite baffled
at this concept, so I interviewed a random guy on the street wearing one of Wawch’s timeless pieces (they’re so popular it wasn’t hard to find a person wearing one).</p>

<p>Me: “So, why did you purchase a watch that can’t even tell what the time is? Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of a watch?”</p>

<p>Random Guy: “Well, it’s timeless.”</p>

<p>Me: “Yeah, but what if you wanted to know the time?”</p>

<p>Random Guy: “Oh, I wouldn’t know how to read it anyways. Isn’t that what phones are for? I’ll just pull it out of my pocket and quickly check the time, saves me a lot
of time compared to trying to read what the watch says.”</p>

<p>Me: “So why did you get the watch?”</p>

<p>Random Guy: “It looks pretty cool. Doesn’t it look sick?! Since it’s timeless, it never gets old. I think that’s mad rad.”</p>

<p>I get Adalbert Bulstrode vibes with this. I thought taking the time out of a watch would make it lose its value, but I guess Wawch’s wrist watches don’t deserve that.
I guess the mechanical motion of a watch will inveitably cause wear, and a timeless watch will truly never get old. The more I think about it, the more brilliant the
concept becomes. Ah yes, timeless watches. Trist Wawch is a genius ahead of my time. A timless watch is not just a fashion statement, it’s a life statement. To make
this article more legit, I’ve interviewed Wawch himself just for completion sake.</p>

<p>Me: “So, how is business after starting your timless watch collection?”</p>

<p>Wawch: “Business is booming. And more than ever. Our company is doing amazing. We have so much money, I was able to give my employees 6 month vacations.”</p>

<p>Me: “Wow, that’s wonderful! Now that sounds like a great company to work at.”</p>

<p>Wawch: “It sure is, but making watches that meet our standard of quality isn’t easy. The training is a trial of itself, and that’s why we’re the best of the best.”</p>

<p>Me: “Good stuff, anything else you would like our readers to know. Maybe something inspirational?”</p>

<p>Wawch: “Well, I hope you can be inspired to buy my new watch collection. These are the series 15Y in scarlet red, everglade green, and brilliant blue. Prices start at
$399, and we can go more if you’d like. Go to your nearest watch store, because it’s probably owned by us! Thanks for your patronage.”</p>

<p>Not very inspirational, but I think he got away with placing a free ad in our paper. Welp, it’s not like I care. It looks like Wawch’s company is going to be doing
pretty well, so I would place some stocks in his company if I were you. With how much money I get from the boss, it will be impossible for me to buy a timeless piece :(

    <title>Machu Picchu</title>

    <description>An article about Machu Picchu</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello all. It’s me, Pablo. It’s been over a year since my last article, and a lot has happened in that time.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/03/16/cliff-hotels.html">last article</a>, I was in a cliff
hotel. Just a stop in the journey to go and see the great Machu Picchu; however, this journey did not have smooth sailing in mind. We began the hike to Machu Picchu, but after about two hours, the conditions in the mountians
became unsafe for travelling. We had to take shelter in a cave we found. We could not head back the way we came
either, the mountain conditions were not good all around the Machu Picchu area. Apparently, there were mines scattered throughout the area, and our communication tools were limited so we could not get any information on why. All we had was a radio which our tour guide was holding onto. For the next few months, we would be living life in this cavern we found.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/cavern_life.jpg" alt="cave" /></p>

<p>I made some new friends in the cave. The most notable was a llama named Sanchez Ronaldo. Sanchez Ronaldo was the life of our party. We could have met a terrible fate to many reasons, but Sanchez Ronaldo ensured boredom would not be one of them. For months, that llama kept on entertaining us throughout the whole day. It’s hard to imagine how, in a not-so-large-cave, a llama could keep us entertained, but Sanchez was able to it. Everything from singing to dancing, Sanchez Ronaldo was a master of. One day he even pulled out a unicycle and began juggling while riding it. Sanchez Ronaldo was truly a llama who was larger than life.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/sanchez_ronaldo.jpg" alt="llama" /></p>

<p>Our time with Sanchez Ronaldo was not to last. One day, about 7-9 months into our stay, we ran out of food. There were children on the tour, so we could not even go a day without food. We were at a loss on what to do, when Sanchez Ronaldo proposed an idea so radical, it shook the very foundations of the world we were living in. “Baaaaaaa.” Sanchez Ronaldo was offering up himself as sacrifice, for our survival. We weren’t going to allow this, but after a few hours and the crying of the children, we realized there was no other choice. We ate Sanchez Ronaldo, and we made sure nothing was wasted. That night was the hardest night of the whole cavern stay. Except the children, no one was able to sleep. A few days later, when our food supply ran out, we were finally saved by a Peru rescue organization. We continued on our journey to Machu Picchu, after leaving a tribute for Sanchez Ronaldo.</p>

<p>The hike to Machu Picchu was not far from the cave, but I could not believe my eyes when we got there.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/machu_picchu_heist.jpg" alt="uh-oh" /></p>

<p>Machu Picchu was being stolen! A helicopter just yanked it out of the ground and was taking it to who knows where! No wonder the mountain conditions were unsafe, these vile criminals were trying to steal Machu Picchu for months! I was simply aghast and had no ounce of energy left in me to do anything about it. I was just going to watch as one of our country’s sacred mounument was being robbed. Then, in the sky, I see a faint image of a llama. My eyes were definitely playing tricks on me, but I swear it was Sanchez Ronaldo. He phased into the helicopter, and after a few seconds, it exploded! Machu Picchu fell to the ground, right where it had been for centuries. What I witnessed was something of legends, these are the mythical stories I learned about as a child. The spirit of Sanchez Ronaldo just saved Machu Picchu! I am now working with a local author to write a novel about Sanchez Ronaldo and his legendary exploits.</p>

<p>We also finally got to finally see Machu Picchu. As a Peruvian myself, 4.5/5.</p>

    <title>Anti-Alcoholics Anonymous</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2022/08/03/aaa.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2022/08/03/aaa.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Anti-Alcoholics Anonymous</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people have heard of AA, alcoholics anonymous. This group is committed to helping people quit or lesson their alcohol addictions. There are many chapters
everywhere, where people can have a safe place to share their stories and be around other people who are on their journey to abstinence. This is a great thing, an
organization helping people to change their habits (only if they want to change their habits ofc!) and providing a safe space to people. We’re all good on that, but
of course as a Hecrenews journalist, I knew there was more to the story. After a few days of searching, man was I right! This group is very obscure, not many people
know about it, but it sure does exist. They are called AAA, Anti-Alcoholics Anonymous. There are for people who are so good at abstaining for alcohol, they have
difficulties trying to drink it. Some of these people are responsible people, and want to enjoy their life a little bit, but they are unable to drink alochol. Whether
it’s spilling the alcohol so it doesn’t get poured into a cup, the inability to open the mouth when the bottle/cup is right in front of it, or rejecting the alcohol
by spitting it out as soon as it enters the mouth, these denizens of society needed their own group to help overcome their problems.</p>

<p>The leader of the local AAA chapter is Love Choolla. Choolla has wanted to ‘sip the drip’ (idk why the kids call it that these days…) ever since she was of legal age
(for drinking, ofc!). “First of all, let me set a few things straight about AAA. Everything things AA is better than AAA, because just like the batteries, AA is bigger
than AAA. But what these people don’t know is that AA and AAA batteries have the same voltage of 1.5 volts!!! We are just as important as AA, and in my opinion, we
have it harder because we have less people. A smaller community always has it more difficult, and we also have less data and experiences to help us overcome our
challenges. To this day, we haven’t been able to cure a single person of extreme abstinence.” Choolla let me attend one AAA meeting so I could get a better picture
of what goes down in the organization. I saw people from all walks of life, and some people weren’t even able to walk! Today there was a new member joining the
organization, a bonus for me so I could report more things.</p>

<p>“Hello everyone, my name is Rink D’Cant. I haven’t been able to drink alcohol since my high school prom, when I was first introduced to it. Now thankfully, I’m
fortunate I have been afflicted with this condition then, because it wouldn’t have been a smart decision to start drinking then. The problem is now I’m at the proper
age and my body can handle it. I just want to drink a few fluid ounces of alcohol every friday to cool down when my week ends, is that so wrong? Everytime I pick up
a glass with alcohol, I drop it. Usually, I can’t even pick it up, it’s like Thor’s hammer. Thank you guys for letting me join you, and I hope one day I can ‘sip the
drip.’” (Why do they say that, idk). After D’Cant’s introduction (and can I just say my man has such a fire name, legend) the members all tried to drink alcohol. Some
people tried sticking out their tongues into a glass of alochol if they couldn’t lift it up. However, everyone’s tongues just retracted back in before touching
the drinks. About 15 more minutes were spent as I sadly watched the people fail to drink alcohol after relenteless perseverance, I admire their grit. “OMG, LOOK!” said
Chooolla. One person was able to get some alcohol into their mouth, this was a breakthrough! They were about to swallow it too, but they spat it back into their cup.
“Dang it! I got to taste it, but I didn’t get to drink it!” Everyone just remained on standby for a minute, and the members decided to end the meeting for the day.</p>

<p>I asked Choolla if there was anything else she wanted to let the folks at home know. “Everyday we are struggling with out problems, and most of the time we just get
laughed at. People don’t think our reality is important, and our misfortunes become other people’s entertainment. This viewpoint needs to stop, maybe they are not
your problems, but that doesn’t mean you can laugh at us. You don’t really know what it’s like until you walk in someone else’s shoes.” Powerful words from Choolla,
I’m sure her sentiment doesn’t only apply to AAA, but people with problems all around the world. Before laughing at someone’s problem or situation, why not lend a
helping hand instead? Well, I’m just a reporter at the end of the day, just gotta please the boss. Anywho, with one breakthrough, I’m sure this local AAA chapter is
on their way to get the first AAA member to drink alcohol, and then start a new era for the AAA where they can actually cure people and help them start drinking
alcohol. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and popping out.</p>

    <title>Ricky The Ravenous Bovine</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2022/07/31/ricky-the-ravenous-bovine.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2022/07/31/ricky-the-ravenous-bovine.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Ricky The Ravenous Bovine</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mara Wilbur runs a traditional family farm. Now, this is not just any small traditional family farm, this farm was run by McDonald; that’s right, Old McDonald. That
was many generations ago, and not many people know about the current status of the farm. When Old McDonald ran the farm, he revolutionized how farming work. The man
created a whole new ‘field’ (🤣 🤣 🤣) and saved so many lives. The name of Old McDonald was spread far and wide, kids today even know about him! Anywho, this isn’t
an article about the legend and greatness of Old McDonald, this is about his farm now. These days, no one even knows about the McDonald farm, it still exists though.
The current descendant of Old McDonald running the farm is Mara Wilbur, wife of Thomas Wilbur. Today’s story is not even about Mara Wilbur, it’s about a character
who I believe is even more interesting. This mischevious mule, this cunning cattle, this malevolent milk-producer. Ricky The Ravenous Bovine. Ricky is a menace to the
fields, a terror to the barnyard, and a force of nature even Buddha fears. Today, we’re gonna learn a little bit about Ricky (and hopefully I survive to tell the tale
😬).</p>

<p>First of all, here is a picture of Ricky.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/ravenous_ricky.jpg" alt="Ravenous Ricky Picture" /></p>

<p>Ricky is a Belgian Blue Cow, a BBC for short. The BBC is a breed of beef cattle from Belgium, and it might also be known as <em>Race de la Moyenne et Haute Belique</em>. Omg,
that sounds so cool!!! Another name for it is dikbil, but <em>Race de La Moyenne et Haute Belique</em>, man what a name! Now, we gotta talk about Ricky’s muscles. Ufff, my man
Ricky over there has some heft. You don’t want him to catch you during a theft! Ricky is always stopped by security for carrying his ‘guns’ everywhere. The pro-breeders
call Ricky’s muscular madness ‘double-muscling.’ This is a phenotype is something the cows inherit, and it increases the amount of muscle fibers, instead of the
individual muscle fibers. It’s hyperplasia vs hypertrophy. Now this is true for all cows like Ricky, what makes Ricky so devious? Well, we’re about to find that out.</p>

<p>Ricky is a rebel. Most farmers are scared of wolves that would eat their sheep, but Wilbur is scared of Ricky the most. He is temperamental, violent, vicious, cunning,
and much more. Ricky gets what he wants, and there is no one (yet) who can stop Ricky. One day Ricky was caught bullying the pigs. Another day he was seen stealing
eggs from some hens. This Tuesday Ricky hopped the fence and went into a china shop, and boy did he cause some damage there. Ricky is just a straight up delinquent,
downright nasty. He is a menace to the fields, and to this day has not been tamed. Wilbur even called PS to try and tame Ricky, and this was the first job PS ever
had to decline. They knew Ricky was out of their league. Wilbur was losing hope, and she started posting flyers for help. After two months, Wilbur was about to quit
the farm, end the legacy of Old McDonald, but luckily Wilbur found the hope needed to keep the Old McDonald legacy alive.</p>

<p>Bovine Blackmailer. An expert in teh field, although quite arcane. Many don’t even know the Bovine Blackmailer exists, but the Bovine Blackmailer can find dirt on
any bovine and submit them to do the will of the client. Once the Bovine Blackmailer saw Wilbur’s flyer on the local bulletin board, all it took was one phone call
to secure the deal. Bovine Blackmailer was about to embark on another mission. Unlike PS, the Bovine Blackmailer was unfazed by the terrors of Ricky, the Blackmailer
just went to work finding all the dirt possible on Ricky. He even hired a man to go to Ricky, and literally scrape all the dirt of him! Now that’s the kind of
diligence a blackmailer needs to really find some good dirt. One day, Wilbur received an envelope in the mail. The job was complete, the Bovine Blackmailer had done
the job. Wilbur left the envelope near Ricky, and proceeded to watch from afar. Ricky opened the envelope (of course he knows how, he is built different), and saw
many photos. There weren’t actually <em>that</em> many photos, but Ricky did not like what he was seeing in the photos. Ricky, for the first time in his life, looked
scared. What exactly did the Bovine Blackmailer find? I will never know, even Wilbur does not know. Ricky destroyed the photos, no one else should ever see what
was in those photos. The Bovine Blackmailer wasn’t just a rural myth, it’s a real entity, and a dangerous one too! Luckily, the client usually ends up satistfied,
and the Bovine Blackmailer never works for a bovine.</p>

<p>These days Ricky is behaving himself and Mara Wilbur is having a much better time at the farm! She is going to continue farming for the rest of her life, now that’s a
happy ending. I know where I’m gonna get my food from now. I’m just glad no one got hurt because of Ricky (except for those pigs probably), those muscles really
are packing quite the punch. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Skip Class or Take the Pass?</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2022/07/24/skip-class-or-take-the-pass.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2022/07/24/skip-class-or-take-the-pass.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Skip Class or Take the Pass?</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s not waste time. Skip class or take the pass, the classic dilemma. Do you be a rowdy, straight up raucous heathen and just dip class, or do you follow the
rules and take the pass? You don’t wanna be a nerd following the rules, but is being a delinquent really worth the risks? I don’t know much about business, but
let’s delve into the risks and rewards.</p>

<h1 id="skipping-class">Skipping Class</h1>

<p>Skipping class, it’s classic. Truly timeless. Ever since classes existed, people have been skipping classes. The point of skipping a class is to not take it. Sometimes,
there are just better things to do. Go to the mall, go to the park, watch a movie, run your business, cure cancer (let’s not lie, learning about John Donne’s
<em>The Flea</em> is one of the best parts of your English class, but it probably won’t help you solve cancer). Here’s the problem, in some countries and some states, children
are required to attend school. A skipper’s biggest enemy, truancy. Children can actually get punished for skipping school. Going to court, failing classes, it’s a big
mess. The trick about skipping is to do it so you won’t get in trouble. Skipping class with impunity is truly a dream. If everyone could skip class, there wouldn’t be
any point. Because skipping class is something one is not supposed to do, that’s what makes it exciting. There is a certain feeling you get when you know you’re
breaking the rules. It’s a complicated topic so we will come back to this. Sometimes skipping is ethical, especially if you are taking a class just for the credit, or
a blow-off class. However, there are some legendary courses one must never skip, and yet some students will still get rowdy and skip these classes. Anywho, don’t
worry about skipping because we will come back to it, let’s discuss taking a pass for some time.</p>

<h1 id="taking-the-pass">Taking the Pass</h1>

<p>‘May I use the bathroom?’ ‘It’s January.’ Getting a pass excuses you from a class. You obtain permission to escape class and go and do your own stuff. Here’s the catch,
you’ll only get 5 minutes of that sweet sweet respite. How will you optimize that time? You could maybe use communication applications to time ‘going to the bathroom’
at the same time to chat with friends, or maybe you just actually need to use the bathroom. Having a pass is good, but you always have to be on the lookout for
E = vB, that’s right, the Hall Monitor. Those sneaky little buggers are always there at the worst times looking to bust you for skipping class. Skipping class by taking
a pass and getting caught is much worse than simply skipping class. If you take the pass too much, your teacher will notice and may prevent you from skipping class. The
legal method does have such a stingy regulation, I don’t think it’s worth it. However, if you know how to optimize those 5 minutes, you should still be able to accomplish
some great stuff. If you’re lucky with your teacher, you may be able to even get away with 30 minutes without being noticed. A true stealth mission, and by following the
‘regulations,’ you won’t have any bad marks on your record.</p>

<h1 id="other-notes">Other Notes</h1>

<p>There is a strategy to give total escape. If you get your parents on board, you can get a pass for skipping any class. You don’t need a doctor’s note if you were only
‘sick’ for a day or two, that’s because you’re not supposed to see a doctor unless you have either something really severe or symptoms for three days. If you can get a
note from your parents, you have the legendary pass. You can skip entire days. However, sometimes you will still need to do the work assigned to you. If you skip out on
your assignments, you might find yourself getting 0s and you could fail the class. That means not only will you have to retake it if there are core requirements, but you
will not be getting credit for this. Your grade point average may be hit, but if you’re focused on the bigger things in life then this shouldn’t be a worry. Truancy court
will probably be your worst nightmare. Time is of the essence, and it’s up to you to make the right decisions to get time. Once you get time, then you just need to figure
out how to make the most of it.</p>

<p>Hope this article gave you some insight. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Man Never Has to Shower Again After Turning Off Dirt Respawn</title>

    <description>An article about Man Never Has to Shower Again After Turning Off Dirt Respawn</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What’s up rapscallions? Today we got an exciting story to keep you on the edge of your seat. Do you hate showering? I mean, sometimes a warm shower is nice, but
stay too long and you’re wasting water. It’s a waste of water <em>and</em> a waste of time! Imagine how big your side hustle could be if you used your shower time for that
instead of showering! Hower Tashe is one man who despises showering. He revels it, absolutely disgusts showering. It’s a complete waste of time, but he has to do it
to stay clean. If he’s too smelly, he’ll be fired from work, and then he won’t be able to live in his apartment anymore. Even worse, he’ll lose access to the internet,
and this is truly terrifying. Not having an income source sure is tuff, but it’s not my problem. As a Hecrenews journalist, our job is to straight up get dirty and
find the truth, no matter what it is. Losing work is one thing, but Tashe could (most likely will) lose all his social status. No one wants to hang out with the stinky
guy anyways, Tashe could even lose his date! Being dirty is a huge problem, but showering (or taking a bath) seemed to be the only way to get rid of this problem, and
not wanting to shower only makes this a catch 22! Anyways, Tashe was more than annoyed with having to clean himself everyday, so he looked for alternative methods.</p>

<p>First Tashe thought he could simply not get dirty. This was impossible. Everwhere he went, he got dirty. Contact with people, objects, air, food. The dirt, grime, and
stink was out to relentlessly get Tashe. After a week of failing to stay clean, Tashe concluded the ‘simply not get dirty,’ method does not work. In fact, research
from a new study indicate 99% of high school students become dirty, but head of SAR Sheeple Dunnel has yet to review this study, so who knows how accurate it may be 🤷. Tashe wasn’t
ready to give up, he was the man who went livid after even thinking about showers, after all. Tashe went ahead and invented a new type of fabric that instantly
vaporized any type of harmful bacteria. After wearing this for three days, Tashe saw no new results. He just burned up the fabric and threw the notes in the trash.
So sad, maybe he could’ve used it for other things but it was a failed invention, after all. Tashe realized even if he blocked out all external sources of dirt, his
own body will produce it. Oh, what misfortune! How Tashe’s own body betrayed him. Tashe was furious, and decided he needed a few days (and a good whiskey) to cool off.</p>

<p>Tashe’s brain was running out of creative juice, so he realized he had to go low to stop this problem. Yes, he had to break his moral code. Tashe was going to learn
Computer Science, what Tashe believed to be mankind’s enemy. Tashe also disliked computer science, he was fine with using computers, but knowing that AI and machine
learning could possibly lead to a terminator, Tashe didn’t want to take his chances. Anyways, Tashe buckled down and started the grind. Man was becoming a sigma male,
and one day, he made a breakthrough. Tashe had coded so much, he was able to figure out how to turn off dirt respawn for him. How did he do it? I don’t know, but he
must’ve been a genius. Now he only had to take one last shower, and see if his code worked. One day passed, then two, then three, and soon a whole month! Tashe did not
have to take a single shower in this time period. The dirt just wouldn’t materialize, it couldn’t. Tashe’s shower 0-death’d the dirt and it couldn’t respawn. Here
is rare footage of what the dirt saw.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/whats_up_hay_man_oh_oops_you_died.png" alt="Death Screen" /></p>

<p>Tashe is now living the time of his living. He started his side hustle of packaging stray leaves and clocked in at 30 thousand in the last quarter. Tashe is making
so much bank, just from the time he gained not taking a shower! Now that’s called hustling. I’ll (probably not) cover Tashe’s leaf packaging business in a future
article, but Tashe has made his impact on the world. Let’s just hope the admins don’t catch wind of this, that may cause some problems for Tashe. Anyways, what
an inspriational story. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2022/07/20/emoji-story.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Emoji Story</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Literature is constantly evolving, it’s a field which will always be relevant. There are many people who have pushed the boundaries of literature. William
Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, Associated Members of the Hecretary Bird Association
(who are <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/02/update-on-the-m-and-m.html">still working on that book</a>. Now, we are living in a revolution, a new
height of literature is being reached.</p>

<p>Witness this masterpiece.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/a_picture_is_a_thousand_words_but_these_emojis_can_express_so_much_more_i_feel_so_englightened.png" alt="Epic story" /></p>

<p>Now <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/07/20/getting-your-goat.html">my last tackle with tough literature</a> was a lot, but this passage has so much more
depth. It’s wrong to call it a passage, this has the worth of a whole series of novels. The author bit can have an entire article on its own, I’ll condense this for
your viewing experience. First there is the profile picture of a lazy red panda loafing around on a tree branch. The art style, the expression, there is so much
weight and character to this image. You can tell more from the author with this profile picture compared to a headshot of a person, in fact, this piece of writing is
so phenomenal, I wouldn’t be surprised if the red panda in the picture is the actual author. Then there is the name. ‘Baddest Rumbler Cat :sunglasses:’. I don’t know
how to escape the colons, so looks like I’ll be stuck with the sunglasses emoji, but it should be colon-sunglasses-colon. Anyways, what a name. I am impressed, there
is so much meaning behind this name. Combined with the profile picture, I am astonished. This is not just any cat, but it is the Baddest Rumbler Cat, and it’s so bad
and has so much style, sunglasses is a part of its name!!! I don’t know what exactly rumbling entails, but I’m sure this is the baddest cat that rumbles. This is a
great figure.</p>

<p>Now onto the story. It begins with *salvador. Usually, stories begin with an exposition, setting up the context for the story. However, in text talk, an asterisk
usually indicates a correction, whether you are correcting your own message or someone else’s. What exactly is Baddest Rumbler Cat :sunglasses: trying to tell with
the first line? I am not qualified enough to tell, I’m just a journalist. Afterwards, the Cat sends a picture of a potted plant, and there are two responses to the
plant, both being the ‘yum’ emoji. This potted planted must be delicious, or at least that’s what I infer from it. Maybe the plant is from El Salvador, or maybe
salvador means something else on its own. Salvador means saviour, or messiah in Catalan, Spanish, and Portuguese. I can provide this information, but I really
cannot help you decipher what it means, BRC 😎 is too great of a writer for me to figure this out. Anyways, next there is a fire. A heart is engulfed in the fire.
Then there is a fire extinguisher, it puts out the fire and the heart is back to normal. Uh-oh! Watch out, there is a fencer. The fencer pokes at the heart, and breaks
it. Oh, what a tragic tale, it hurts even my heart! Is this a love story, a tragedy, a comment on the current world? I will never know, maybe it’s all of them.</p>

<p>The heart has gone through so much. It was blazing! Now this could be due to passion, in a positive sense, or it could’ve been like a house fire, in a tragic sense.
All we can infer is eventually, that fire died out, and the heart returned to normal. What is the significane of the potted plant before the heart? What is the
significance of salvador and how do they all relate? Maybe salvador means there is no saviour, or it could mean the story takes place in El Salvador. What we do
know, is at the end of the story, the heart is broken. This is what is so beautiful about this story, it can mean so many different things depending on your outlook
and perspective. Each picture on its own is worth a thousand words, when you combine multiple pictures together, you have what’s basically a book. Let’s observe
the story from a romantic view, like with <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. There is a burning passion, probably falling in love. After some time, things begin to cool down and
the lustful heart has calmed, but it is still a heart and still has feelings. However, tragedy strikes and either the lovee or an outside force swiftly strikes the
heart, and all that’s left is a broken heart. This is so sad. Now to get even sadder, we can observe the story through the lens of a tragedy, like <em>Macbeth</em>. Natural
tragedy strikes, maybe environmental or societal, and someone gets caught up in it. It hurts, but there is light at the end of the tunnel, and the tragedy is
eventually overcome. The person has grown from this, stronger than ever, but life is not up to that person. The fencer, representing even greater tradgedy, strikes!
This time, the heart is broken for good. Overcoming one kind of adversity may make you stronger, but if you live in the biggest lake, you’ve never seen the ocean.</p>

<p>I am [REDACTED] and this is sooo deep. I can’t wait to read more from BRC 😎. In the meantime, I will keep on reading this and learn more about life from it.
This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <description>An article about February 31st Part 3</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What’s up guys, it’s been a bit… Anyways, I know you loyal Hecrenews readers have been at the edge of your seats, waiting for this part 3 since part 2 was
released on April 17. The wait is over, because now the article is finally here. Some bad news guys, my memory’s been bad lately, this must be the consequence of
not writing in a bit. Anyways, we’re gonna have to pad this a bit, let’s start by dropping a quick link to part one and part two ;)</p>

<p><a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/03/20/february-thirty-first.html">Part one</a></p>

<p><a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/04/17/february-thirty-first.html">Part two</a></p>

<p>Alright, time to get back into the action. Time began returning to normal with the precense of Adalbert Bulstrode, my man is a legend. Anyways, I noticed someone
I knew walking admist the spectators, why, that’s Isiah Dobrilla! How could I forget! I thought he was zapped along with the head of SAR, Sheeple Dunnell and
Brian Jones, but I guess he was a bit farther away so he just teleported to the crowd. Anyways, you would think there was an epic battle, but no. During his ‘time’,
in the void where space and time is unknown, Adalbert Bulstrode discovered much more physics than what any man knows. He had the knowledge to create the future the
way he wanted it to be written, or at least that’s what I want to think, let me be a fanboy. Oops, I’m supposed to be a journalist, ummmm…. don’t tell anyone, okay?</p>

<p>Bulstrode wasted no time in trapping Brain Jones in a ‘Physics Prison’, he called it. He pulled out this contraption from his belt, it was a small cube, and, using
projectile motion, he perfectlly threw the box onto Brian Jones. Brain Jones was sealed inside the box, I asked Bulstrode how it worked but he ensured me I wouldn’t
understand, and even if I wrote it down, no one would be able to understand it. He did tell me there would be a lot of bots inside the box, but I have no clue what
he’s on, I mean what he’s talking about. :{| Then the most unfortunate even took place. Bulstrode told me he had to return to the space time void, for two reasons.
One was that the Physics Prison could not contain Brain Jones forever, he would eventually escape, and Bulstrode just wanted to study it more. Such dedication to
science, if only I was as dedicated to journalism… However, he left me with a better communication device to give to the SAR team, so that was pretty cool. Anyways,
he left quickly, he is a busy man after all, and everyone was in confusion and disarray. Once everyone got back to their senses, Sheeple Dunnell had to go back to
Wah Turtistin to help him out, and Isiah Dobrilla stayed to watch the match.</p>

<p>Everyone was hyped up for the match between Shroops the Almighty and King Louie to continue, but we got scammed. Because of the confusion of the events, the match
would be postponed till February 32nd!!! What was this?!?!?! Hopefully, since it was February 31st, it wouldn’t be that long of a wait. I went hope and took a nap,
but that nap turned into a sleep. When I woke up the next day, the date showed March 1st! I got scammed, February 32nd was skipped, and now I will have to try my
luck again next year! Oh, woe is me, why do I always get such bad luck. I still have my ticket, and will be waiting for their epic match. In the meanwhile, you can
count on our team at the Hecrenews to keep you updated on Shroops the Almighty, and possibly King Louie if we can find his location. This has been Mister Mjir,
popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <description>An article about February 31st Part 2</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys, it’s been a while. I’m still afflicted by the procrastinatovirus. Doctors have been saying its incurable. Anyways, that’s a story for another time.
If you don’t know about this February 31st stuff, be sure to check out
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/03/20/february-thirty-first.html">part 1</a>.</p>

<p>Where we left off, the fated fight between Shroops and King Louie was abruptly ceased by the apperance of Brain Jones and head of Hecrenews SAR, Sheeple
Dunnell. Four formidable foes now stood in the boxing ring, and the fight was only beginning. Sheeple Dunnell had a flow-meter from the
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/02/28/encounter-at-the-goorlicker.html">most recent water testing</a> and was ready to fight; however, the
full extent of Brain Jones’ power is still unknown. Shroops the Almighty was especially furious because he was about to land a hit on King Louie. Nevertheless,
he didn’t want to get mixed up in something against the HBA, so he took the side of Sheeple Donnell. Shroops dashed towards Brian Jones and unleashed a punch
that could have sent a mountain flying to the moon. However, Brian Jones strengthened his skin by increasing the force of the molecular bonds of his
epidermial cells. He also increased his mass, so even if Shroops applied a large force (which he did), he would not accelerate. Momentum had to be
conserved, so a huge gust of wind blew towards the audience on the recieving side of the ring. The audience were getting worried about what was about to unfold,
so they began packing their bags and exiting the arena. I of course had to stay and witness history, but I found shelter behind the chairs.</p>

<p>Brian Jones had expert control over physics, he would be a formidable foe. King Louie decided to help out Shroops, because defeating the foe would allow the
two to resume their boxing match. King Louie’s indomitable posture was unable to unnerve Brian Jones. Louie threw a hefty punch from the opposite corner of
the ring but Brian Jones set up a magnetic field, and due to the metal content in Louie’s blood, the punch was deflected. Truly, things were looking helpless
for the bunch. Brian Jones wasn’t even trying, he was just messing around. One man had power much greater than Shroops the Almighty, King Louie, and Sheeple
Donalvain himself! It was rigged, unfair, but Brian Jones was only getting started.</p>

<p>Thank goodness he didn’t try causing Uranium to decay, he certainly could have. What Brian Jones did, however, was stop time. By speeding up beyond the
speed of light, Brian Jones was able to stop time. Somehow, I wasn’t affected, just like in the Daredevil Jack incident. Brain Jones was breaking the rules
of the universe. The speed of light was supposed to be the maximum speed in any condition, but Brain Jones exceeded all limits. He casually walked towards
Sheeple Duonnelll, and then noticed I wasn’t frozen. Without saying a word, the man began summoning more lightning. I had no escape, and I couldn’t get
grounded. I thought I would have to use the super-secret-emergency-only-use-in-a-catastrophic-moment HBA special device number 23, serial number 4022,
but my luck prevented the need of the super-secret-emergency-only-use-in-a-catastrophic-moment HBA special device number 23, serial number 4022. A portal of
light opened up, and out from it emerged ADALBERT BULSTRODE. THE KING HAD RETURNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Adalbert Bulstrode increased the dielectric
constant of the air so lightning wouldn’t form with Brian Jones’ voltage. “It’s been a while,” said Bulstrode. Ooh, and would you look at the time. It’s
time for me to resume ‘productive’ work. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <description>An article about February 31st</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/02/28/encounter-at-the-goorlicker.html">recents events at the Goorlicker</a> I just went home to go to
sleep. When I woke up, I was alarmed. Not only did my alarm clock wake me up, but the date on all my clocks really knocked of my socks! It was February- still,
but it was February 31st!!! How could this be?! It is every programmer’s worst nightmare to deal with dates that don’t exist, and for the safety of the site
I prolonged posting this article in fear of crashing it. Can it even handle a February 31st? I mean it probably can but then there arises a problem of when
to post the article on our social media<del>s</del>. Anywho, I had remembered something very important I needed to see. I went to my drawer and grabbed a ticket.
This ticket was for a very special event. Shroops the Mighty vs King Louie, the world’s greatest boxing match slated to take place on February 31st. I
drove to the arena and was greeted by surprise after surprise.</p>

<p>Before the match started there were two major events. First, a movie premiered. This was not just any movie, but a movie by the amazing unknown director the
Hecrenews is still hunting down! No one knows their identity, but their movies are sure to break the box office every time. The name of the movie was
‘Teen Dost Tum Toast,’ and it was a masterpiece. Now I don’t know what Teen Dost Tum Toast means, but with the help of Google and Google translate I think
it means three friends, you’re toast. (Can we get a hindi person to confirm this?) The audience made the movie even better. We were all cheering, jeering,
and leering as the characters did what they did. Unfortunately for everyone not at the arena, the movie was nowhere to be found the next day. All trace of it
was lost. Anyone who tried to pirate the movie was escorted out by guards who were just built different. I shudder when I think of what happened to those poor
piraters. Poor pirates are almost extinct these days, and they were feared. Anywho, the movie was great. Out of 10 points, I can’t give it a score lower than
a 10, so I gave it an 11.</p>

<p>After the amazing movie, my ears were blessed. You may remember
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/03/music-group-recieves-backlash-on-song-delay.html">ARMD</a>, and mainly how they weren’t able to produce
any songs. Well, they said they would make a song by February 31st, and they weren’t kidding. ARMD gave a live performance of their first song, and I don’t
remember the name because the crowd was cheering like crazy. ARMD’s music is beautiful, I would dare say it’s even better than
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/12/23/such-beef-good-grief-armd-vs-system-of-a-don.html">SOAD’s</a> songs. I felt a new emotion during that song,
and it can only be described as ‘ARMD music.’</p>

<p>Now, here was the biggest event. Everyone was restless for this one, we’ve bought tickets and waited years for a February 31st. It was the boxing match
between Shroops the Mighty and King Louie, King of the Swingers and Jungle VIP. Everyone was seated, and the announcer began. “From the depths of the
jungles in India, the Jungle VIP, the King of the Swingers, make some noise for King Louie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”. The audience went crazy,
the person in front of me did a backflip while still being seated in their seat, I don’t even know how that was possible. King Louie starts walking towards
the ring in the most intimidatin fashion possible. His long arms propel him forwads and his expression was once of certain victory. Instead of a bucket
of water to use in between rounds, Louie had a bucket of banana paste, can you believe this guy? Absolutely bonkers. The announcer started talking again,
and the audience went dead silent. “Now introducing the most powerful VEG, no human, alive. It’s Shroooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooppppps the
Miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiightyyy!!!! Wait, hold your applause. I have just received some news that while training to prepare for this very
match, Shroops has now become Shroops the Almighty!!!” The audience wents nuts. A conga line formed and people started break-dancing. Half of the spectators
were running around the seats like children. It was like a party scene from the Great Gatsby. Shroops walked towards the ring. He removed his robe halfway
through, revealing his new array of <del>guns</del> muscles. Daang, was Shroops the Almighty buff or what?! I could barely recognize this guy. He must’ve been
photosynthesizing for ages, or maybe there was something in those
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/02/13/drink-company-turns-digital.html">closets</a> he was always appaering from. Both contestants were finally
in the ring, and it was time to begin the boxing matches of not a lifetime, of not a century, but of all time. The judge was none other than Fred Dome,
and he was also serving refreshments in the stands. That is something only Fred Dome can do.</p>

<p>The match started and Shroops and Louie started hopping around the ring. You can tell they had perfected the 50-50 weight distribution. While analyzing
Shroops was pretty straightforward, I had never seen a Bornean Orangutan box before, so I was in for a treat. King Louie utilized a posture unique to him,
one which took advantage of his long arms. Shroops threw the first swing, Louie dodged left and countered, going for Shroops’ core. Shroops <em>teleported</em>
backwards, I mean this man moved so fast, and the audience almost went crazy again (they were crazy but the crazy of the audience was at a whole other
level). Louie then went on the offensive, making use of his god-tier reach. He swung right, and immediately swung left, Shroops blocked the one on the
right and ducked under the one on the left. He ran towards Louie and tried to go for an uppercut put King Louie grabbed Shroops’ arms with his feet.
Was this even legal?? I don’t know, Wopps Minor has certainly covered more sports than me so I’ll have to check with him later. Shroops was in a sticky
situation, but King Louie couldn’t really move either. Time was almost out for the first round, and Shroops escaped Louie’s feet! He went straight for
Louie’s face and I swear it connected, but it only almost did. The moment before Shroops was about to enlighten King Louie’s face with the Almighty VEG
power, an explosion propogated in the middle of the ring. Out of the explosion came Sheeple Dunnell, head of SAR, and Brain Jones.</p>

<p>This article is getting pretty long, so unfortunately we’ll have to leave it at a cliffhanger. Fear not, the 2nd part will surely come soon, I hope. This
has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Hecrenews Intern revealed to be Pointy Building</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2022/03/18/hecrenews-intern-revealed-to-be-pointy-building.html</link>

    <description>An article about Hecrenews Intern revealed to be Pointy Building</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the beginning of its existence, the Hecrenews has had a highly handy hodgepodge of hierarchy. Us writers are the public face of the organization, all controlled by a shadowy-yet-scary boss. Below, you have our science and research (SAR) team, headed up by Sheeple Dunnell and containing such esteemed members as Blat Beck and Fred Dome. Alongside those, you have interviewers and investigative reporters, such as Biggin Mammo and Fred Dome, and at the bottom of the bottom, the interns. This group would consist of Eif al-Tawa, Fred Dome (ofc), and a grand total of no one else.</p>

<p>Eif al-Tawa, known for generally being shady and the definition of malicious, has been a member of the hecrenews for almost as long as the Hecrenews has been the hecrenews, coming on board just to seemingly <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/20/writing-in-all-caps-found-to-be-more-persuasive.html">terrorize Blat Beck</a> during a Science and Research investigation. However, recent evidence has come to light that really brings to our minds the question: “Did we ever really know Eif al-Tawa?”</p>

<p>During a leak of Tawa’s most private information (conducted bi-monthly in order to preserve workplace camaraderie), the Hecrenews collectively discovered a most interesting pic. Why, in a folder labeled “Cheeky Selfies,” Eif al-Tawa had snuck in a picture of a pointy French building! Specifically, this point French building:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/pointy_french_building.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Because geography isn’t a subject in schools, we have no idea what this pointy French building could be, or where it could be located, or even what it’s relation could be to a shrimpy, malicious intern named Eif al-Tawa. Thus, we consulted Sheeple Dunnell about the conclusions we should draw from this most surprising finding. Through the power of logical induction, he gave us authors this piece of wisdom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bruh if it’s in the selfie folder its a selfie. Obviously that intern is that building. We don’t employ buildings here, so I say boot ‘im. Serves him right for curdling my coffee the other day.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But being an unbiased source of news, we sought to get all sides of the story. Thus, we journeyed to Eif al-Tawa’s home of Paris, France (his internship was mostly online, he zoomed in unless his presence was needed) to see his take on the findings. We asked question after question, but the Eif al-Tawa just stayed still, motionless, towering over us all. Was this a show of disrespect? It certainly seemed like that; our entire interrogatory staff stayed there shouting questions and prodding him until kindly taken away by the French police. Eif al-Tawa never said a word, leading us to wonder. Did we imagine every other word “said” by him prior? Just how much acid are we on, actually?</p>

<p>We’re thus far undecided as an organization about what to do about this scandalous scandal. What will happen of Eif al-Tawa? I’ll tell you what, why don’t we let our loyal, dutiful, never-miss-a-single-article readers decide? Just click the link below and Judge al-Tawa’s Fate!!!</p>

<p><a href="https://strawpoll.com/polls/wby5lbLBXZA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a></p>

<hr />

<p>This business is very troubling. If al-Tawa hid the fact that he was not a person, but instead a pointy French building, could he be hiding something else? Could he be in kahoots (or quizlets) with the Don? We thought we’d forgive him for joining the Don’s <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/12/23/such-beef-good-grief-armd-vs-system-of-a-don.html">wildly successful metal group</a>, but maybe more nefarious things are at hand. 😢🙏📠. Wopps out.</p>

    <description>An article about Cliff Hotels</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Machu Picchu is a great place. It’s one of the most iconic places in Peru! Just search up Peru in Google and go to images, and you will see pictures of the Incan
structures built long, long ago. The architecture of ancient civilization is amazing, and merits an article of its own! However, today we are going to be talking
about the Sacred Valley, the place where Machu Picchu is in. The Sacred Valley is in the Cusco region of Peru, here’s a handy-dandy diagram:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/glorious_peru.jpg" alt="Map of Peru" /></p>

<p>Irrigated by the Urubamba River itself, our ancestors were able to use the area because of the rich soil. The Sacred Valley is a beautiful place, you’ll even find
rainbow mountains there.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/rainbow_mountain.jpg" alt="Peru rainbow mountain" /></p>

<p>Now the Sacred Valley is an awesome place, and it brings in hundreds of thousands of tourists per year. If you are planning to visit the Sacred Valley in Peru, then
you should consider booking a cliff hotel. They are pods on the cliff of mountains, perfect for a quick retreat during a hike to Machu Picchu. First you will climb
up to the pods, either through iron rungs or via hiking. It is tough to get up there, but it is well worth the struggle. Not only are you rewarded with a glass of
wine but the view is absolutely astonishing! Seeing the Sacred Valley from the pods is a surreal experience which you will remember for the rest of your life. Your guide
will give you a belly-filling dinner, and you can stargaze all night long or until you sleep. What a great experience, I should go there again. At the end of your stay
you get to take a zip wire to get back down, isn’t that great!</p>

<p>The Sacred Valley has an amazing view, stay tuned to hear a bit on the ruins of Machu Picchu itself!</p>

    <title>Snails Want their Rights</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2022/03/12/snails-want-their-rights.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2022/03/12/snails-want-their-rights.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Snails Want their Rights</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deep in the depths of the Amazon one can find the creature known as a giant Amazonian river snail. In Peru we just call these churos. They’re delicious when in a stew
and they’re a great source of protein! These gastropods can grow up to six inches, and are found in Northeastern Peru and a few other select locations near the
Amazon river. Everyone loves a good churo stew, unless, you are the stew.</p>

<p>Recently snails have began a progressive movement where they are fighting for their rights. Representative Kash from the Snail Party has even flown into Peru to speak
to the masses. I was lucky enough to interview Kash! He was a busy man; all the papers were trying to get some words from him. However, after he heard I’m with the
Hecrenews he gleefully rejected the other reporters and arranged an interview with me. Here’s what he has to say.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Snails have been disrespected for thousands of years. We’re the main carriers of the worst parasites around, we’re considered pests, and we have salt poured on us.
We’re a peaceful species, on that doesn’t deserve such animosity.
That’s why I chose to become a representative of the Snail Party. We promote, above al lelse, recognition and rights for all snails.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Outstanding words from an official Snail Party representatives. Kash is hard at work gaining public support, working with legislators, and lobbying coporations to
advance the rights of snails. Some business owners (like our good old pal,
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/07/26/in-a-world-full-of-pants-man-struggles-to-find-pant.html">Bule</a>) are giving their full support to the snail party,
but convincing the bigger coporations poses a major challenge Kash and the Snail Party must overcome. One major issue the snails are tackling right now is the
consumption of snails. It is unethical, it is unhumane they say. It does harms the snails progress on their social reformation, because they kept on getting eaten. If
snails can prevent people from eating them, they will be able to make an astronomical amount of progress on their liberties.</p>

<p>The human world is very challenging for snails. Salt can easily knock snails down a peg. Salt absorbs water form the snail through their slimy exterior through osmosis,
and the snails soon die due to dehydration. The poor mollusks stand little chance! However, while snails are slimy, they generally do no harm to humans. Humans do
much more harm the snails. Take the giant Amazonian river snails for example. They peacefully reside in the jungle, and humans invade their home and pluck them for
consumption. Truly horrific.</p>

<p>However, I am not a politician, I am just a Hecrenews reporter from Peru. The final decision is for you, the loyal Hecrenews viewer, to make.</p>

    <title>Twin Forgets Which One They Are</title>

    <description>An article about Twin Forgets Which One They Are</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local twins Faraday and Augusta Wint have retained their individual identities for years through some stroke of luck, but sadly, such times have come to a close. They have fallen to the age old twin trap: Neither one knows which twin they are.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/twin_illustration.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Above is an artist’s depiction of two hypothetical example twins on a summer day. Unfortunately, the artist was one of Hecrenews’s own, and you know how our budget is so screwed that we had to have an interviewer <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/02/17/get-free-plane-tickets-with-this-one-simple-trick.html">extradited</a> rather than pay for a plane ticket home. Still, it perfectly illustrates the twin dilemma: Can you distinguish between the two people you see above? No? Well, then they probably can’t either. And that’s what’s sadly happened to the twins Wint.</p>

<p>One of Faraday and Augusta came to Hnews HQ one day, to seek guidance about his/her situation. We of course, instead of giving them counsel, turned their sob story into sweet, sweet internet hits.</p>

<p>The thing is, the twin (whoever it was) that visited us looked rather, y’know, womanly, which leads us to believe that it <em>could</em> have been Augusta Wint. But as always, the hecrenews maintained its unbiased approach to reporting the news. That’s right, you get only the facts with us. The long flowing locks, DNA-proven double X chromosomes, and the twin saying they were a girl <em>may</em> have been evidence that the twin the Hecrenews spoke to was Augusta Wint, but you can never tell what the hip-and-trendy parents name their children these days. All up in the air, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>What’s most surprising is the fact that Faraday and Augusta are in no means identical twins. According to a description from a close family friend, they are “as unlike in body, character, and morals as two people could be. I’m surprised they’re even related in the first place.”</p>

<p>Hopefully we may sooner or later find some evidence to help each twin identify themselves. It’s terrible that this is such a large problem in society, even with fraternal twins. After contacting us about his/her plight, the twin Wint went off to the Himalayas  to find themselves. While they could be searching for a drivers license or other form of identification, they seemed confident that the snowy peaks, sharper than Shere Khan’s very shoulder blades, would help them in their quest to find out which twin they are.</p>

<hr />
<p>That’s all for today, kids! And remember, if you ever find yourself with a lookalike who looks like you, moves like you, and might even think like you, make sure you’re not just looking into a mirror before proclaiming your long lost twin to the world. And if they turn into the forward scouts of a secret alien invasion, heed my grandfather’s words and “rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat</p>

    <title>Encounter at the Goorlicker</title>

    <description>An article about Encounter at the Goorlicker</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
You may remember Wah Turtistin from <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/10/07/alarming-nearby-water-sources-reach-near-boiling-levels.html">a few articles back</a>. In fact, you should remember Turtistin from a few articles back!! Did you forget? Then there is a chance you are not a loyal reader, shame. Anywho, Turtistin is back at it again testing the mighty Goorlicker stream, and now he’s teamed up with our very own Sheeple Dumbell. They’re gonna make a great team, but I foresee the testing mostly being Donel teaching Turtistin how to use the equipment, the scientific method, and basic common knowledge. Dunnell brought his very own briefcase, and gave a pamphlet to Turtistin explaining the 10 levels of water testing. Actually, Donnell scribbled something on the pamphlet, and now there were 11 levels. Turtistin was in the newly added level 0, he had a long way to go before reaching the higher levels where he could use Sheeple Donalbain’s hand-crafted tools, vetted by all of SAR themselves.
</p>

<p>
The duo started with testing pH. It should have been easy, but Turtistin had a mad compulsion to drop everything into the water. Especially true with chemical substances, but pH strips seemed to work for Turtistin as well. After losing 12 pH strips to the Goorlicker, Duenell and Turtistin finally moved onto temperature. Coincidentially, they encountered my man, Isiah Dobrilla. If you don’t know Dobrilla, then you really must be living under a rock like that one starfish, I forgot his name. They chatted for some time, it seems Dobrilla is doing much better these days; the man is always part of something big. Dobrilla was just walking along the trail and enjoying the view of the mighty Goorlicker, and after the conversation he continued walking along.
</p>

<p>
After an excruciating two and a half hours, Donell and Turtistin finally finished one location- out of four. 😿😿😿. They went to spot number two, but as they pulled out the sulfuric acid they knew something was up. Some dark force was lurking behind them and lo and behold- it was Brian Jones!!! “I can recognize that tie-die shirt from miles away,” said Dunnel. Dunnell instructed Turtistin to fall back and take shelter, because Brian Jones can turn any normal person insane. Luckilly for our SAR lead, he knew a thing or two about science, so he had a sort of immunity. Brian jones carried with him a metal pole attached to a contraption, and once the clouds began to darken Donnell knew what was going down. “Curse those electrostatics!” “You’ll need years of integration before you get to my level Sheeple,” remarked Jones. Lighting struck, and Sheeple was about to experience the last shock of his life, but then came along Mr. Dobrilla chasing a slipper floating in the Goorlicker. While the machine was supposed to shock Dunnell, the zzzzap was redirected to Dobrilla, who donned a metal ring. This was a ring given to him by the Nigerian Prince himself, and after being struck a very strange event occured.
</p>

<p>
The head of SAR, the altruistic Dobrilla, and the exiled Brian Jones all vanished. Turtistin just stood in shock. He was about to have a mental breakdown, but he steeled his nerves and continued the water testing, someone had to do it. Someone had to ensure the mighty Goorlicker was still alive and kicking. Turtistin surprisingly picked up the water testing fast; he reached level seven already by the time he was done with spot 3! Turtistin is setting up his future, and it’s a very inspirational message to all of our loyal readers. Sometimes we will lose the ones most important to us, but it is in these times one must stay strong and keep pushing towards tomorrow. Greatness can be achieved, and maybe you too can become a level 10 water tester!
</p>

<p>
Now what happened to the three who disappeared, where did they go? Who knows as it's a mystery for next time. The new boss pays better but I don't have the energy to investigat further.
This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.

    <title>Get Free Plane Tickets with this One Simple Trick!</title>

    <description>An article about Get Free Plane Tickets with this One Simple Trick!</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With travel restrictions possible coming to a close soon, there’s soon to be a mad stampede for the nearest planes as people don’t hesitate to catch up on their traveling, vacationing, and in-flight entertainmenting. However, according to some handy dandy economic principles, this future positive demand shock will result in an increase in the equilibrium price for plane tickets. Oh heavens!</p>

<p>But don’t worry. The hecrenews has gotchu fam. Recently, one of our star interviewers, Biggin Mammo, made the mistake of getting stranded in Agra, India.  Unfortunately, the Hecretary Bird Association, after learning that we spent our travel funds (supposed to be for annual pilgrimages to Room 808, the birthplace of the modern HBA), on a random trip to the Taj Mahal <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/01/31/are-you-smarter-than-the-taj-mahal.html">to interview it</a> and missed the plane back, wasn’t too willing to hand us enough funding for a ticket back home. We therefore had no funds, and had one overseas Mammo to get back.</p>

<p>The good people at the Hecrenews (us) were hard-pressed to come up with a solution to get our beloved Biggin Mammo back. Without our star interviewer, we would be run aground in terms of article productivity, as if we weren’t already. After all, we would only have our associate interviewer Fred Dome on the <del>interrogation</del>interviewing team.</p>

<p>Thus, we searched hard for a solution. And then, as if by magic, a solution presented itself to us! On the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO7XPD8xGt_rdGOtJ6u8yvHwD1soTwJ_64jk5kr59cf3bfdw/viewform?usp=send_form">hecrenews article tip line</a> one day, we were astonished to find a most interesting tip (we were astonished because nobody ever gives us news, but that’s beside the point😭). You might recognize the name from <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/19/schoolteacher-devotes-life-to-changing-those-of-criminals.html">Ms. Eritrea Take’s School for Uncouth Criminals</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/ctaa_hecrenews_article_tip_line.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>While I’m sure the stealing of the Eiffel Tower is a matter of national concern (and soon to be the second famous landmark-based article in recent memory), the tip gave us writers an inkling of an idea. It may sound far-fetched, but listen. The mystery criminal was extradited to the US and all, but for FREE! We now had a plan. But what crime would Biggin Mammo have to commit that would be so severe to get him extradited, yet not depraved to the point where he would be instantly lynched. What would fit? And then it hit.</p>

<p>On a video call with Biggin Mammo, we were astonished to see how much he had changed since he left to interview the Taj Mahal. Where there was once, well, a Biggin, now we were faced with a scrawnier, turbaned fellow. Must be the veg food that caused him to lose so much body mass. Smh veg. But I digress. We were so appalled at the state of our poor Mammo that we immediately resolved to force him to commit a crime of some sort, just so that we could get him back (and hopefully throw a delightfully non vegetarian welcome-back feast).</p>

<p>In the end, hecrenews staff decided to go for a <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/20/writing-in-all-caps-found-to-be-more-persuasive.html">tried and true</a> method. Mammo stood in a busy market corner, proclaiming his (false, ofc) affiliation with the snaxii to all. While there were some who seemed to take a liking to him, and thought he would dance if they played a tune, the vast majority mobbed Mammo within seconds. Fortunately, Mammo, having already fallen into a comma, had a hardened soul and was not mentally rekt like Blat Beck.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, Biggin Mammo was immediately arrested for “public snaxialaxiality” and is to be extradited to the US, where he will face criminal charges in front of a high court, and atone for his crimes. But at the very least, it’s free for us!</p>

<p>Wopps Out.</p>

    <description>An article about Drink Company Turns Digital</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Change is something businesses have to deal with. Whenever doing a transaction, there will be change and sometimes customers will ask for some change
when they pay more than they need to. Oh wait, that’s the wrong kind of change. Businesses must adapt to the time or else they will be outdated and
no one will need them anymore. Just take all the businesses you don’t know for an example. Do you know any of them? Of course not! Do you want your
business to succeed or fail? If you want to be at the top, you got to be on the top of you’re game. And that’s exactly what this drink company had
to do to succeed.</p>

<p>Grocky Turbell is the head figure at Da Ginger Ale, a hard drink company. Their business is doing well, and the locals do enjoy a good Ginger Ale
from Da Ginger Ale, but Turbell was bothered by something. They were going to stay local forever! Most people don’t need a product that’s good, they
need a product that’s convient. Online retailers can dish out decent products, and people are more likely to buy those because it’s easier than
going out to ol Grocky Turbell’s brick and mortar store. They’re so brick and mortar they use a brick and mortar to make their drinks! Isn’t that wild?
People are lazy, so the hardworking people at Da Ginger Ale are kind of outdated. The locals do really enjoy the drinks, take Ulfita Mammos for example.
Mammos comes over every friday with ‘the squad’ to relax after a hard week of worth with some good drink. “I know Grocky is setting his heights higher,
but I would be sad if they switched to decent products just for convience. They really are making some magic.” Turbell is facing an ethical dilemma.
There is a wrong and right choice, but it is hard to figure out what to do. Even after following all the steps of resolving an ethical dilemma, Turbell
was still flabbergasted and bamboozled. Everything was going to stay ambiguous, until Turbell opened up the closet in his shop.</p>

<p>From the closet, our favorite legend, <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/30/an-update-on-our-legal-troubles.html">Shroops the Mighty</a>
appears! It’s very strange how he is <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/10/16/hecrenews-staff-faces-rampant-epidemic.html">appearing from closets</a>
but to each his own, am I right? Shroops slept for a solid 30 minutes while Turbell attempted to wake him up, and as soon as he did Shroops made the
offer. “Let’s cut to the chase. I’ll take the AL from DA GINGER ALE, and you can take your business to the next level.” The most astonishing
part of this transaction is how Shroops made the move. How can the embodiment of procrastination take such actions? We are still trying to figure it
out (and probably never will). Anyways, Turbell thought long and hard, and decided his answer. “Yes.” Shroops took the AL and went back into the
closet. When Turbell opened the closet, he was gone! He did notice a strange kind of tunnel though. Turbell quickly changed the business name to
Da E-Ginger. Instead of selling Ginger Ale, the company will now sell ginger online. What a change!</p>

<p>Sales were skyrocketing, the value of the business increased by at least a thousand, and Turbell went global. If you weren’t buying your ginger from
Da E-Ginger, you weren’t buying real ginger. Althought Turbell basically became an overnight success, locals such as Mammos are still upset. Luckilly,
Turbell still offers his ginger ale services to those dedicated patrons, but only on Fridays and weekends. During the week they focus on their
online ginger business. What a happy story. In fact, I’ve already ordered some ginger from Da E-Ginger to give to Banana The Human for his next dish!
It’s gonna be a great gift.</p>

<p>Now the most loyal of you Hecrenews readers are dying to know, what happened to Shroops? Well, it appears in his closet travels, he is preparing for
something great, something huge. We do not know what it is yet, but I think I can deduce what he’s going to do with those newly gained letters.
Shroops the Mighty will become Shroops the Almighty! This will make him unstoppable! But what does he need the power for? Who knows, but something
big is going to happen soon.</p>

<p>This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Are you smarter than the Taj Mahal?</title>

    <description>An article about Are you smarter than the Taj Mahal?</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With recent widespread concerns about the effectiveness of public education, especially considering the recent influx of <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/01/29/lack-of-creative-stimulation-drives-teens-to-ad.html">Academic Dishonesty and Grand Mega Theft Auto</a>, we’ve received several handy dandy tips on the <a href="https://forms.gle/HFJd8rVfybWDjfJv9">Hecrenews Article Tip Line</a> discussing peoples’ plights and how they’re unsure if the education they spent so long getting is any good. Because of this, hecrenews staff, with the help of our greatest geek Sheeple Dunnel, have devised this handy-dandy quiz-guide to help you determine if you were actually taught right.</p>

<p>Now, some of you might be wondering: “Why is my intellect being compared to that of the Taj Mahal? Why not another landmark, or you know, an actual sentient person?” Well you see, because we at hecrenews really truly had no idea of the extent to which schools were failing to meet their standards (again, this may or may not be related to the massive increase in cheeky cheating across the board), we decided to go for a low baseline. Using some delicious HBA funds, Hecrenews interviewer Biggin Mammo asked the Taj Mahal the same questions we’ll soon ask you, so after the quiz, check back to see how you did! Are you really smarter than the Taj Mahal?</p>

<h1 id="q1-name-one-integral-quality-of-the-hecretary-bird">Q1: Name one integral quality of the Hecretary bird</h1>
<p>Back in India, when asked this, the Taj Mahal didn’t say anything. In fact, it didn’t do anything! Biggin Mammo was stumped, until he flipped the question card over. Of course a central characteristic of the Hecretary Bird is laziness, or the act of not doing anything! That Taj Mahal, I tell you. So bright. You, as a very loyal fan of the hecrenews and hecreverse (wink wink) must have gotten that one right, so let’s ramp it up a bit.</p>

<h1 id="q2-if-in-1938-karoly-the-shooter-was-28-years-and-in-1948-he-became-38-years-how-old-would-he-have-been-in-1896">Q2: If in 1938 Karoly the Shooter was 28 years and in 1948 he became 38 years, how old would he have been in 1896?</h1>
<p>Once again, the Taj Mahal just stood there saying nothing until time ran out. It just so happens that this is correct! If Karoly had 28 years under his belt in 1938, he would have to be born around 1910, and so would have been nothing in 1896! This is one incredibly intelligent monument, I have to say.</p>

<h1 id="q3-what-is-the-name-of-the-second-largest-lake-in-south-america">Q3: What is the name of the second largest lake in South America?</h1>
<h1 id="now-stop-here-dont-look-ahead-i-see-you-cheeky-fellow-trying-to-get-a-glimpse-at-the-answer-without-answering-the-question-yourself-">NOW STOP HERE. DON’T LOOK AHEAD. I SEE YOU CHEEKY FELLOW, TRYING TO GET A GLIMPSE AT THE ANSWER WITHOUT ANSWERING THE QUESTION YOURSELF 😏</h1>
<p>Here, nothing happened after Biggin Mammo asked the question (as per usual), which caused his eyes to wander. And lo and behold, there was a bird turf war just beginning, off to the side. Armies of peacocks and crows gathered, facing each other with such enmity. It would be a nonvegetarian’s paradise! But Mammo is a trained hecrenews employee. He steeled his nerves, and did what any interviewer does best: listened. “Tweety!” “Caw-caw!!” And that was all that he needed, for the second largest lake in South America is Titicaca between Bolivia and Peru. It was obviously a sign from the divine power of the Taj Mahal, conveying its answer through the local fauna. Mammo was just floored. He almost converted to Hinduism right then and there!</p>

<h1 id="q4-what-is-unique-about-macramé-textiles">Q4: What is unique about Macramé textiles?</h1>
<p>Mammo, having purchased a pagdi from a local already, had to wait quite some time before he decided that the Taj Mahal was back to saying nothing again. The sun had almost gone down when he wearily flipped over the fourth question card, revealing knotting. Of course, the Taj Mahal’s different pronunciation can be dismissed as an accent thing. It’s not good to judge like that, no?</p>

<h1 id="q5-what-do-the-poor-have-and-the-rich-dont-and-will-kill-you-if-you-eat-it">Q5: What do the poor have and the rich don’t, and will kill you if you eat it?</h1>
<p>Biggin Mammo was quite the riddle enthusiast back in grade school, and knew the answer to this question even after he finished reading it. He also realized that if he knew it, then undoubtedly the Taj Mahal, which knew all about Macramé and Lake Titicaca, would know it too. Therefore, it almost didn’t surprise him at all when the giant marble building said nothing in response. Of course, “nothing” is the right answer. Mammo at once started profusely bowing. Unfortunately, at that point it was practically midnight and the HBA only gave us a ticket to Agra at 8 am and from there at 8 pm. We’ll have to get Biggin Mammo back home to Hecrenews HQ so he can keep interviewing like he does so well someday. But I guess that’s a later problem.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Taj Mahal, mighty as it is, got all 5 of our quiz questions right, thoroughly exceeding Mammo’s expectations, who is now full-hinduism as he expects it to make himself smarter. How far he has come from falling into commas all willy-nilly. But that begs the question: How many did YOU get right? Are you really smarter than the Taj Mahal? What will the public education system have to say about this? I don’t know the answers to any of these questions. Wopps out.</p>

    <title>Lack of Creative Stimulation Drives Teens to AD</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2022/01/29/lack-of-creative-stimulation-drives-teens-to-ad.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2022/01/29/lack-of-creative-stimulation-drives-teens-to-ad.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Lack of Creative Stimulation Drives Teens to AD</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While sciencey-types across the country are still hard at work trying to find the cause, there has been a widespread decrease in creative stimulation across the nation. What may be the cause? Are folks bored with learning online? Or is the Lesser Zecretary Bird bringing down a blessing of boredom? I guess we’ll never know, the jury’s still out on that one.</p>

<p>All this humdrum boredom has unfortunately led to an increase in <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/24/math-teacher-accused-of-academic-dishonestly.html">Academic Dishonesty</a>, colloquially referred to as <strong>AD</strong>. Schools across the country are succumbing to its seductive allure, but especially so for local school <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/10/16/leafblower-standoff.html">Leafblower Elementary</a>. There, the <strong>AD</strong> scene is constantly evolving, and almost has a mind of its own. Hecrenews correspondent Fred Dome spoke to local Leafblower legend (After Daredevil Jack, Anna Džana, Billa, etc etc lorem ipsum) Nanaawi Shantyman.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So, how do you think the increase in <strong>AD</strong> has affected you personally? I heard that many think it’s unfair to the few hardworking students that are left.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<strong>AD</strong>?? What’s that?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Well, y’know. When you do the cheeky. When you go to the corner, and exchange the facts. When you ask innocent-sounding questions such as “What’s on Bio Test?” All of that falls under the big, wide, filthy, treacherous umbrella of <strong>AD</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ohh, you must be talking about GMTA!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, Fred Dome inwardly cringes because of the overwhelming use of teenage acronyms found in the public school system. For more information on this juicy, juicy subject, you can check out <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/authors/banana_the_human.html">Banana The Human’s</a> most recent article! His constant flood of articles will familiarize you with all the latest lingo and lango, and if you’re lucky, maybe even slango. Anyways, where was I? Oh right:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What does GMTA stand for? God Must Take Alcohol? Not the most elementary-school-friendly acronym, I must say…”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Why Fred Dome, you blind, blithering fool, GMTA stands for Grand Mega Theft Auto, of course! You know, when you do something that someone else did over again, mostly without crediting them?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So when you <strong>AD</strong>?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yeah, yeah, whatever you old fogeys call it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Well, whatever it is, it’s happening, and it’s a problem?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Is it? I dunno, I personally have benefited greatly from the influx of GMTA in the public school system. The present vacuum in the Leafblower Elementary social structure after Daredevil Jack’s vanquishing and the Džana regime eventually crumbling into anarchy allowed a lot of us GMTA dealer-types to prosper.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How so?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Well, the coursework at Leafblower is a little intense, but a little intimidation can get you a long way. I’ve practiced my ‘Don face’ for years, as my bedroom mirror was my only friend through my long, hard <em>(shudders)</em> toddler years. But it’s paid off. With one look, I can get an instant stream of answers from any and all of my underclassmen. They’ll go out and press the request answer button on their assignments just for me. Isn’t being a 5th grader just great?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite Nanaawi Shantyman’s best <strong>AD</strong>—or—GMTA empire-building dreams, the establishment is cracking down on this outburst of cheaty stuff immediately. After his interview with young Shantyman, Dome headed next door to the teachers’ lounge to converse with the unofficial chamberlain of cheating (prevention), Teemha Ranche. Ranche has collected together a group of student volunteers to help educate the rest of Leafblower Elementary’s populace about cheating prevention.</p>

<p>They call themselves VEC, which stands for a number of things, depending on who you ask. Shantyman called them Very Entertaining Cretins, while Ranche maintains that the official name is the Vee Excite Children club. Who knows what the true acronym is? VEC very energetically campaigns for the decrease of <strong>AD</strong> (and maybe GMTA too), but is generally regarded as a bunch of bumbling barnacles trying to get rid of an integral part of the elementary school experience.</p>

<p>Nanaawi is attempting to “get rid of” Mrs. Ranche and the rest of VEC, but unfortunately found herself in a sticky situation. You see, somehow despite their incompetence in essentially every field(They were going to put QR codes on TREES!), VEC had attracted the Don’s benevolent and watchful eye. Who is this Don? You may recognize him from his role in the ever-climbing hit metal group <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/12/23/such-beef-good-grief-armd-vs-system-of-a-don.html">SOAD</a>(System of a Don).</p>

<p>“Doing away with” the heads of VEC will definitely be a tall task with the Don’s backing there to go up against. While the hecrenews definitely does not promote <strong>AD</strong> or GMTA of any sort, we wish Nanaawi Shantyman all the luck in the world as she goes up against the Don in her quest to build a network for every answer to every question that could ever be asked . A new google, if you will.</p>

<hr />
<p>It started with that <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/24/math-teacher-accused-of-academic-dishonestly.html">math teacher</a>, but now it seems that Academic Dishonesty and its sister crime, Grand Mega Theft Auto, are taking over public schools across the nation. Back in my ancestors’ days, there was no mega-<strong>AD</strong> ring like you’d see in Leafblower. In fact, if my grandpoop was still here to talk about the present situation, he’d say “rat-a-tat-tat-ta</p>

    <title>Is Your Librarian Secretly a Vampire?</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/12/23/is-your-librarian-secretly-a-vampire.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/12/23/is-your-librarian-secretly-a-vampire.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Is Your Librarian Secretly a Vampire?</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not everything is as it seems. Is your librarian a vampire? Learn the tell-tale signs and be ready for anything. You may never suspect your librarian to be a vampire,
but that is exactly what they are aiming for. This incomprehensive guide will let you be able to deduce the truth.</p>

<h1 id="melanin-activation">Melanin Activation</h1>
<p>Is your librarian’s melanin activated, or are they as pale as the paper on their books? This is one of the first signs you should be able to tell. Being pale, untanned,
or not having one’s melanin activated is a sign of not being exposed to the sun. Is it just that librarian’s are reclusive and don’t go out because they are too busy
staying in their library, of course not! Vampires cannot be in the sunlight, that is their weakness. They are not pale by choice, but by survival. They cannot be out
in the sun. So if you can see these signs, you may be on to something</p>

<h1 id="sightings">Sightings</h1>
<p>Do you ever see your librarian outside of the library? If you don’t, then the library is probably their hiding place/base. You see teachers roaming around the school
and if you’re very lucky, you may notice that they are people just like you when they are at the grocery store. However, if you do not see your librarian anywhere
expect for the library, then you should start becoming suspicious. Remember vampires are nocturnal, so they are supposed to be sleeping during the day. Librarians are
awake to convince you they are not vampires, but do not be fooled!</p>

<h1 id="secret-basement-under-the-library">Secret Basement Under the Library</h1>
<p>Do you have to climb a set of stairs before you get to your library? If you do, there is most certainly a basement under that place. What is kept in this basement, food
supply of course. All the people who have used a computer when they are not 18, the people caught with overdue books, the people being too loud. All the rulebreakers
are kept there. In fact, if you read the fine print when getting your library card, you may see a section about this. Unfortunately, it is usually in white text, so
it’s impossible to read because it is the same color as the paper. If it is a school library, I hear the International Baccalaureate kids are kept in there. How
unfortunate. With a constant food source, these vampires will not be going anywhere anytime soon. Once the basement is constructed though, you will probably not be
able to destroy it, because you probably don’t have the power too.</p>

<h1 id="odors">Odors</h1>
<p>Does your librarian smell unsually good? I mean, if you know then you are more than a little bit creepy, but what you can tell is their aversion to bad smells,
especially garlic. Vampires hate garlic, it is a classic way to tell if someone is a vampire. Unfortunately, there are also many regular people who don’t like
garlic as well, so don’t go full Salem Witch Trials if you make this observation.</p>

<h1 id="levitation">Levitation</h1>
<p>If your librarian is flying then you need to run.</p>

<h1 id="bats">Bats</h1>
<p>You will probably see bats on a day where they don’t bring a zoo guest speaker into the building. In fact, many times bats aren’t even part of the program. If the
zoo guest speaker is talking about 4-legged creatures who do not fly and you see bats in the building, calmly exit the building.</p>

<h1 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h1>
<p>These aren’t all the signs for sure, but it’s a good start. The best solution is migrate as far away as you can. Thanks to techonological advancements, vampires can
even survive in the sun now. Once that sun resistance vaccine comes out we’re done for. If your friends are stuck in the basement, we recommend a party of at least
101 people per vampire that you know, and 500 more just in case. It will be hard to escape back, so bring garlic, holy water, and all the knick-knacks. Only a few
people who tried actually succeeded, and they became revered heroes. This will be great if you are a high school student needing something significant for your
college apps, but no sane person would attempt this.</p>

<p>It’s a good thing I have a network and resources for obtaining books outside of a library system. Bookstores are once source. You gotta think, how can libraries
operate a business if you can borrow the books for free? Something is 100% sketch with that, but who am I to judge? Anywho, this has been Mister Mjir, popping in
and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Such Beef, Good Grief: ARMD vs. System of a Don</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/12/23/such-beef-good-grief-armd-vs-system-of-a-don.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/12/23/such-beef-good-grief-armd-vs-system-of-a-don.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Such Beef, Good Grief: ARMD vs. System of a Don</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hit group <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-330378554">ARMD</a> has yet to come out with another banger. Oh, when will February 31st arrive? Despite this, however, it seems their growing popularity has attracted some unwanted attention. A shady force is brewing on the music horizon, and it comes in the form of up-and-coming hit music group System of a Don.</p>

<p>But what seems so positively insidious about a band? Well, for one, it’s members. Some months ago, a rival news site suddenly <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/07/06/rival-newsite-loses-by-default.html">crumbled into ruin</a> (or so we thought). However, it’s all too prevalent that the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/10/05/how-to-properly-wallop-a-simian.html">then-infamous</a> Monkey Beater is still alive and kicking (and beating, ofc). And now, he’s drumming! 😱🙀😱‼️</p>

<p>In addition to Monkey Beater, the lead guitarist of System of a Don is equally nefarious former(😡) hecrenews intern Eif al-Tawa. He was a spy all along! Even <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/02/18/cars-gain-ability-to-text-while-drivers-talk.html">Brian Jones</a> seems to have turned to the dark side (or the darker side?) and joined this gang of nefarious proportions. But none can compare with SOAD (for short)’s lead singer. For months, whispers had been traveling on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/169lGK8JCoFEiNn_BJ2qnCrRfSToUoxTfo1zBlcsn18U/viewform?edit_requested=true">Hecrenews Tip Line</a> about someone more shady than a sugar maple. Someone more in the hood than Little Red Riding. Someone who got a 0 on the Rice Purity test for “relentless <strong>AD</strong>ing. Someone known to the public only as: The Don.</p>

<p>The Don’s doubtlessly devastating debut did definitely disrupt denizens’ daily duties. Oops, my “D” key got stuck for a minute there. It’s better now, at least. System of a Don was an explosive smash-hit right from the get-go. Their first (and as of now only) album, Boxicity, has definitely made more than a splash, sending a tidal wave of sponsorships, endorsements, and accolades towards the group.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/system_of_a_don_boxicity.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Obviously, our four-lettered food fanatics didn’t want to have any of that. And so began, a beef to end all beefs. So beefy this was, one could almost call it buffalo. SOAD vs. ARMD. A great and legendary battle!</p>

<p>Of course there was only room enough for one acronym-based music group in this here town. The instant System of a Don publishes their next song, ARMD says they’ll put out a right and proper diss track. However, considering they still haven’t published <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/03/music-group-recieves-backlash-on-song-delay.html">that song</a> they said they were going to all those months ago, it’s safe to say that SOAD’s raw productivity gives them the upper hand, at least for now. We can only hope that ARMD gets their gumption back, and their D back, to combat this monstrous threat.</p>

<hr />

<p>We can only hope The Don doesn’t use his newfound prowess and public appeal to do some cheeky stuff. T’would be bad for everyone involved. Monkey Beater, Eif al-Tawa, Brian Jones, and The Don make a fearsome foursome indeed. The sheer level of evilosity can’t be matched!</p>

<p>The hecrenews, as the one news source to rule them all, will of course keep you updated on any and all world-ending events that arise from SOAD’s musical successes. We must take heart in these troubling times and listen to only the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zre6TreHfFg">truest</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C98BbpoVWF8"> music</a> out there. Wopps out.</p>

<p>Edit by HAC (Hecrenews Article Quality Control): While the title seems to imply that beef brings grief, please note that this is not a sentiment expressed by the hecrenews as a whole. We think the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/11/29/scandal-man-brings-nonveg-food-to-veg-party.html">cleanser</a> may have rubbed off on him some.</p>

    <title>Research Shows People Could Fly in Ancient Times</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/12/19/research-shows-people-could-fly-in-ancient-times.html</link>

    <description>An article about Research Shows People Could Fly in Ancient Times</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pre 1600s the human race enjoyed many opportunities of interacting with the world around them which are simply impossible today. Most notably, people could fly,
levitate, and do all sorts of aerial movements with impunity. Humanity was in a golden age; life was great and beautiful. Everything was swell until one man came into
being, the man who would start a chain reaction of events leading to the forces of good and (mostly) evil affecting us today. Isaac Newton.</p>

<p>This mischevious man invented the nemesis of air travel: gravity. Gravity is a force which brings things to the ground. The sky’s the limit, but gravity will make it
hard to reach the sky. Many people were in the middle of their commute (via flying ofc!) to work, school, and whever you commute and they all just stopped and fell to
the ground. All in an instant, the instant Newton decided gravity was going to be a thing and invented it. Oh the tragedy, imagine if I could fly today! Newton invented
many things, but the important ones really are his Newtonian Physics. Apparently he did some math work as well but I’m sure it couldn’t have been that important. I
bet he didn’t even know calculus, that stuff is tuff stuff. Anywho, there are other people who added their own stuff to physics and even made their own versions, like
Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein is pretty famous, our rival news site (whose current status is unknown), made at least
<a href="https://melruzers.blogspot.com/2020/08/albert-einstein-quote-4.html">4 quotes</a> about Einstein. He thought he was a special kid and called his physics special something,
I’m not sure, I’m not a physicist. I’ll have to call in the head of SAR later to figure that out.</p>

<p>This despicable Newton created so many hardships for humans, but something even worse. A dark power exists; an arcane force only a few can touch. Those who can master
this power gain unimaginable power, probably more than Justice, Jocose, and whatever the other one was but I’m sure it’s in
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/09/06/the-jocose-gang.html">this article</a>. There is one notable figure who has mastered the dark arts known as phyiscs.
We’ve mentioned him before, this man is <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/02/18/cars-gain-ability-to-text-while-drivers-talk.html">Brian Jones</a>. Many have
sought his power and have gone insane, the folks in some HBA organization are figuring out how to deal with him. Newton is the creator of physics, Brian Jones is the
evil wielder of the dark arts, but who is the hero? I would say it’s my main man, Adalbert Bulstrode, but he is currently trapped in some space-time thing only the
people at SAR really understand what’s happening. Until Bulstrode returns, our world has little hope. Fortunately, Brian Jones hasn’t made any big moves yet, but
this could also be a bad thing, because we don’t know what he’s up to.</p>

<p>Ah, I got an update from the man, Sheeple Donnell himself. If you don’t know, you can read
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/12/03/local-sciencey-man-rediscovers-last-name.html">this guy</a> and learn a bit more about Donell. The main man at
SAR who really knows all his stuff. So apparently, there is this thing in physics called dynamics, which explains why things move. Dynamics is all about forces,
and gravity is a kind of force. This originates from mass, and mass attracts other mass, so there is a gravitational field wherever there is mass. I don’t understand
Dunel’s magic words but I think he’s saying I create gravity. I am part of the problem of people being unable to fly. However, my contacts from various Hecrenews
subdivisions are informing me that people never flew in the past, Newton never invented gravity, it was always there to begin with. I am a bit skeptical, but who
really knows what happened in the past, am I right? I don’t really know where the research is from, but I trust Dunnel’s words more than any paper from any other
guy out there, so we are going with what he says.</p>

<p>While the Newton thing may still not be 100% known, Brian Jones still remains an imminent threat, and something must be done. In the mean time, this has been Mister
Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <description>An article about Local Sciencey Man Rediscovers last Name</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may know us writers (and the H-bird of course) as the face of he renews, but there’s a lot that goes on behind the scenes. Teams upon teams of intrepid investigative reporters, backend analysts, interviewers, and interns strive to make the articles you know and love possible. All of these teams include and for the most part consist of <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/20/man-takes-initiative-during-social-distancing-ends-up-with-every-job.html">Fred Dome</a>, of course. But there has been one individual, consistently carrying our article accuracy from close to the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/20/writing-in-all-caps-found-to-be-more-persuasive.html">very beginning</a>. Unfortunately, we at the hecrenews do not know his name. No, this is no masked benefactor that is a normal citizen by day but saves news organization legitimacy by night. Instead, we’ve simply forgotten.</p>

<p>The first name, now everyone knows that. Whenever this character enters the Hecrenews HQ, he’s greeted by resounding pats on the back and more than a few “What’s popping Sheeple?”s. However, there’s not a soul that could tell you his last name with complete certainty. Slightly <em>nefarious</em> hecrenews intern Eif al-Tawa was always of the opinion that Sheeple’s last name was Dunnell, saying that “‘Dunnell’ is what he introduced himself as all those months ago, when we were torturing that Blat Beck fellow (who deserved everything ofc (mwahahaha)).”</p>

<p>However, not everyone retains the same point of view. When asked about it, assistant nerdy-fellow Fred Dome said that “Dunnel was always his name. I first joined the SAR force when we attempted to find the next <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/27/hecrenews-determines-whether-or-not-it-is-opposite-day.html">Opposite Day</a>, and he told me very explicitly that his name was ‘Dunnell, with two l’s, and don’t you forget it, man-that-i-see-in-basically-every-possible-position.’”</p>

<p>Oh wait. I guess everyone does retain the same point of view. During a mass audit of all hecrenews articles while the coding team was busy figuring out how to cite image sources (<strong>AD</strong> just doesn’t do), we could find no evidence of any author calling Sheeple Dunnell Sheeple Dunnel. And yet, there was still ambiguity over his actual name.</p>

<p>For the last couple months or so, everyone at HQ has referred to our chief nerdy man as Sheeple Dunnel/Dunnell, so as to not enrage him too much. It’s not good practice to set a man of science against you, is what hector’s grandfather says at least. So long story short, everyone didn’t want to upset Dunnell so out of pure politeness, they introduced the possibility of his last name being “Dunnel.” <em>(An aside to Esteemed Dr. Dunnell: that last sentence was a remark of the general state of the hecrenews staff, not any one gun-holding dog’s opinion of what an intelligent scientist’s name truly is)</em></p>

<p>Now Sheeple Dunnell’s name was so addled by the numerous <del>preposterous</del>legitimate investigations the hecrenews had put him through that he started to have doubts about his own last name. Hopefully the information that no one actually called him Sheeple Dunnel will put his existential crisis to ease.</p>

<p>—-</p>

<p>Now, I’m not sure what sort of beef(or plant) hector’s grandfather had with scientist-types in the past, but sure do hope it never escalated to all-out warfare. Wopps out.</p>

    <title>Man brings Nonveg food to Veg party</title>

    <description>An article about Man brings Nonveg food to Veg party</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the best <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/28/calamity-resolved.html">omnivorous</a> intervention and peacekeeping efforts, the age-old feud between Veg and Nonveg continues to rage underneath the surface. Time and time again, short skirmishes will erupt, over small things like secretly seasoning a salad with a dry rub or a nonvegetarian eating a vegetarian. Who can blame them, right?</p>

<p>Recently, things came to a head when local non veg Mii Teater was invited by his vegetarian friend (already rare enough for a veg and nonveg to be so friendly) Yom Ipplants to a potluck party, to celebrate an early Thanksgiving. Little did Teater know that this was no ordinary party. It was a veg party 😲😱!</p>

<p>Slated to take place at 6:00 pm on November 25th, the gathering was a meeting of the Royal Vegetarian Society, a group of the most veg vegetarians to ever graze off the face of the Earth. Pictured below are portraits of their founding members.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/members_of_royal_vegetarian_society.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Being a friendly neighborhood nonveg, Teater thought he would supply some Thxgiving turkey to what he thought was just an innocuous get-together. After the <em>incident</em>, sobbing profusely, he told Hecrenews correspondent Fred Dome that “it was only meant as a friendly [blubbering made words incomprehensible]… I didn’t think that they would… Ooohhhh the flashbacks!”</p>

<p>Everything was going normally, everyone was chillaxing and faxing smoothly together in the beginning. Yom Ipplants, ever the gracious host, invited the gang to a game of Pin the Asparagus on the Sweet Potato, a vegetarian classic. Naturally, Teater was bemused by what seemed to him a strange occurrence, but he went along with it. After Dome found him on the streets curled into a fetal position, he said he thought “it was just a joke, like to be edgy and veggy and everything. I-I never thought they w-would ALL actually be… VEG!… The Humanity!” <em>(at this point, Teater is flickering in and out of a cat-atonic state (meeeoooow))</em></p>

<p>All of these fun and games went on until dinner time, when Mii Teater went into his car and brought out the Thxgiving Turkey under a hemisphere-shaped dish cover. The veggers, all the lot of them, were captivated by this mystery meal. It smelled foreign, but not a single vegetarian could identify the aroma. Maybe it was a rare delicacy, such as vegetarian game from the enchanted broccoli forest. At any rate, all this wonder was swiftly replaced with horror once Teater, with a “Voila! (you lolla)” revealed the roasted, glistening Thxgiving turkey.</p>

<p>The years of amicable companionship (as companion-like a veg and a nonveg can be, anyways) that Yom Ipplants had shared with Mii Teater went out the window as soon as he saw the bird being the centerpiece of his table. Quickly, two soybean-eaters restrained him, and took him to The Cleanser. After all, every self-respecting vegetarian household has one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Excerpted from Teater’s terrified ramblings: “THE CLEANSER! Ohhh, noooo, the cleanser! I saw horrible things in there, horrible I tell you.” <em>[blood-curdling screech]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last thing poor Mii Teater remembers from that night is waking up on a cold city street, afraid, alone, and with a certain craving for broccoli. He hopes to regain his nonvegginess in the future and has signed up for meat therapy, but until then, he remains a slave to the fruits, nuts, starches, and vegetables that all vegetarians know and enjoy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Hopefully with the help of mediating omnivores this little incident doesn’t blow up into full-on warfare. All this may sound grim and apocalyptic, but it’s nothing compared to the literal wars between veg and nonveg that were fought in my grandfather’s day.  If he was here, he’d go all “rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-t</p>

    <title>CDC to distribute millions of vaccine shots</title>

    <description>An article about CDC to distribute millions of vaccine shots</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Resistance to vaccines has been a problem plaguing society for much of our recent pandemics. With a significant portion of the population refusing vaccines for a variety of reasons (*cough cough* (that’s what the unvaccinated peeps might be doing right now)), we run the risk of never reading her immunity. However, judging from the results of a recent study, that may be about to change.</p>

<p>Spearheaded by Sheeple (Dunnel/Dunnell/etc etc lorem ipsum), SAR sought to try and find a way for anti-vaxxers and the such to be more incentivized to get vaccinated. Multiple trials were conducted, testing a variety of alternative vaccine administrations methods. Purely for logical purposes, the scientists on the team elected to rent a charter bus in order to sample vaccine responsiveness in populations all across the nation. When asked about this rather unorthodox decision while boarding the bus, Dunnel/Dunnell, shirtless <em>(:grimace:)</em> and dressed in swimming trunks, only said that it was “the best method to minimalist bias in the data set.” Saying thus, he and the rest of the scientists packed all manner of scientific implements into the bus, namely a couple surfboards, ski poles, snorkeling gear, and hiking boots. The bus left with a screech, leaving only burnt rubber and the echoes of a surprisingly exuberant “Cowabunga!” in the background. Dang I guess those scientists really love conducting surveys, huh.</p>

<p>The inoculation station, as soon became called, traveled all across the country. From Snaxachusetts to Snaxe Francisco, scientists tried a variety of methods to see which would be accepted by the public. When infused into mashed potatoes, the vaccine was received quite well in Snaskatoon but not anywhere in Snaxas, and the aerosol spray was universally dismissed as “diddly darn pseudosciencey witchcraft”. After completing their cross-nation <del>vacation</del>research project, the scientists came back to hecrenews HQ, looking about 50x more refreshed than they should have been after traveling for months doing nothing but eating, sleeping, and surveying. Kinda sus, no? But data was data.</p>

<p>And from this data-esque data, Sheeple Dunnel/Dunnell was able to extrapolate that most Americans, instead of taking to the wildly unique administrations like the mRNA moisturizer or the Viral Vector Vindaloo, just wanted regular old shots. Sheeple quickly contacted his fellow nerdy-buds at the CDC with his findings, and they contacted their nerdier-buds to start up some vaccine shot production.</p>

<p>Needless to say, shots with an infusion of Covid vaccine will be nothing but an instant hit. Might even make them tastier, who knows😋? Bars and other alcoholly places seem to be places of mass congregation as well that would greatly benefit from having a more vaccinated client population.</p>

<hr />

<p>I know I can’t wait to see how the new COVID-19 shots impact the current situation, how about you? This has been hector, popping in and now popping out. :wink: :smirk:</p>

    <title>Local Dealership Gives out Cars for Free</title>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/10/27/local-dealership-gives-out-cars-for-free.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Local Dealership Gives out Cars for Free</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Service is one of the cornerstones to being a good citizen and a person. When was the last time you helped out your fellow human beings? For local (car) dealer Skåmyu Güet, this last time would be very recent indeed. In fact, he’s still helping out those less fortunate by dealing out <del>jocose</del> cars for free! Can you believe it?</p>

<p>Güet has owned the Güet ‘Em While They’re Hot! dealership for about 2years now. Initially sales were booming, he says. “Why, there were so many people all lining up to purchase themselves a car, I desperately had to hire some help. Luckily, I found <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/20/man-takes-initiative-during-social-distancing-ends-up-with-every-job.html">this man</a> online, and I was so impressed by his extensive resume I hired him on the spot. Why, he’s even the POTUS!” However, as the years passed, less and less people showed up to good ol’ Güet ‘Em While They’re Hot! It might have something to do with the fact that all cars sold came with heated seats (as per the name), so much so that you could easily identify a Güet customer by the particular red shade of their backside. Because of this, Skåmyu found himself in a dangerous situation. Sales falling, progress stalling, Güet bawling, you get the idea.</p>

<p>Just as Frankenstein came to Mary Shelley in a dream, so did Güet’s money-making banger of an idea. Amidst dreaming up other fantastical creations, very acid trip-like, he heard an eerie voice, described by himself as “not unlike a scrawny, slightly nefarious news intern.” Skåmyu quickly got to work. Even at 3 am, he was so spurred by this idea borne of seeming nothingness that he immediately got to work. By morning, it was evident that Skåmyu Güet had spent the entirety of the wee hours of the morning painting a huge sign that towered over the traditional “Scalding Steals!”</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/free_cars_sold_here.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The line at Güet ‘Em While They’re Hot! Was huge, snaking twice around the building and even onto the road. Everyone sure wanted them some free cars. However, no one, not a single soul was astute enough to notice a teeny weeny <del><a href="https://shirt.woot.com/offers/aubergenie">aubergenie</a></del> asterisk cleverly placed there by Skåmyu, clearly living up to his name.</p>

<p>Once everyone had made it into the store and was marveling at their brand-spanking new cars, Güet dropped his (metaphorical) bombshell. While the cars were free, every breath of air would cost users $150,000. Quick as you can say “Nando Nanda, eso es mi apellido”, every customer was holding their breath and running out of the store as fast as they could.</p>

<p>Unfortunately (for them), it’s rather hard to do both of those things at once. Skåmyu Güet and his hired hands collected the people that had passed out from a lack of oxygen and will soon make them pay for every breath they took during that fated sale.</p>

<p>Rops.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well well well, that reminds me of the whole <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/14/local-streaming-service-deletes-cancel-subscription-button.html">Nit Flex</a> shenanigans, now doesn’t it? Gee, I hope those <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/09/29/the-resistance-trying-to-take-down-nit-flex.html">hackers</a> are doing alright. So much for the cure to that <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/10/16/hecrenews-staff-faces-rampant-epidemic.html">epidemic</a> that our SAR head found, I know I’m still feeling residual procrastinatovirus effects. Ok now I’m done trying to increase internal link impressions. Wopps out.</p>

    <description>An article about Hecrenews Staff Faces Rampant Epidemic</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent times (let’s say a week or so), you may have found there to be more hecrenews articles than of late. Well, this sort of good luck doesn’t come around just by chance, now does it. To tell you the truth, the h-news staff has been afflicted by a terribly terrible epidemic as of late, a very beastly thing.</p>

<p>Sheeple Dunnell/Dunnel (jury still out on that one btw (jk jk we’re just milking this situation to pad the word count (and maybe make an article out of it too))) was among the first to recover. He quickly sequenced the disease’s eigenvalues and differentiated the Paranthropus Index for the mystery epidemic’s known Skyr Factor. This obviously gave him the hereditarial right to name the disease, and he coined the term Procrastinatovirus.</p>

<p>The effects of the Procrastinatovirus were severe, to say the least. Every single author was under the <del>influence</del> effects of the disease, rendering us completely incapable of <del>coming up with</del> accurately reporting news stories.</p>

<p>Luckily, Hecrenews had an ace up its sleeve. A Peruvian ace, to be precise. Pablo (from Peru, to be Pablovianly double-precise).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/authors/pablo.jpg" alt="" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Artist’s depiction of Pablo, our Pablovian Peruvian savior</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>While Sheeple Dunnel/Dunnell/Donnel? cooked up a cure, Pablo was able to carry the hecrenews, posting about all the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/07/26/in-a-world-full-of-pants-man-struggles-to-find-pant.html">goings</a>-<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/07/08/alpaca-or-llamas.html">on</a> in Peru and ensuring that our loyal readers were always filled to the brim with genuine, newsworthy stories. Eventually Dunnel/etc/etc tracked down the source of the procrastinatovirus, and was astonished.</p>

<p>In an old, abandoned corner of an old, abandoned closet in the <del>old, abandoned</del> brand spankin’ new hecrenews office, was one <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/30/an-update-on-our-legal-troubles.html">Shroops the Mighty</a>, procrastinatore extraordinaire. It seems that Shroops had gone into the closet for some purpose many months ago, but just ended up procrastinating on getting back out. The daily delay vibes were so strong that it ended up being contagious, and soon the rest of the staff was horribly infected, not able to do anything but act like general wastefellows.</p>

<p>But all is well with the world. Just as snaxe oil is used to make antivenom (or at least that’s what the very convincing salesman on the street told me), Sheeple produced the antidote from Shroops. While I’m sure that process was very painful, Shroops the Mighty was not available for comment, as he was very busy doing something vague and nonspecific. With the antidote in hand, Dunnel/whatever quickly administered it to the writers and rest of the staff, and we were back, better than ever, and ready to post on the reg.</p>

<p>Except Banana the Human of course; he’s been drawn away do deal with some grapes this time.</p>

<hr />

<p>Hmmm, <a href="https://wordcounter.net/">this handy-dandy tool</a> says that this article’s reading level is at that of a college student. I guess you can say that I went all “rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat” on the membean here.</p>

    <title>Inspiring: Man loses 500 Pounds Overnight</title>

    <description>An article about Inspiring: Man loses 500 Pounds Overnight</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people feel that keeping your weight in control is key to living a happy, healthy life. Area Britisher Josgot Rhobbed took this life lesson to the extreme just a couple of days ago, when he reported that he had lost 500 pounds in just a single night. What sorcery! Hope he gives me some good weight loss tips, ngl.</p>

<p>Indeed, I think Josgot’s inspiration for his extreme weight loss came from the sad, sad saga of <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/21/one-man-to-take-revenge-on-deserts-for-enormous-weight-gain.html">Bert Bulstrode</a>, who ate a 13.5” cheesecake and consequently was rendered essentially immobile until his digestive juices did their thing. No one would want to be in a plight like Bulstrode’s, so it’s only sensible that Mr. Rhobbed quickly attempted to shed all his extra pounds. Haters (like SAR’s chief poindexter, Sheeple Dunnell(or Dunnel, the jury’s still out on that one)) would say that that level of weight loss is impossible, unless you lose an arm and a leg (or more likely, both at once). However, I say that if you aspire with your ideas, then nearly anything is possible, including losing 500 pounds overnight.</p>

<p>Josgot actually agreed to an interview with Hecrenews’s own Biggin Mammo (who for very ambiguous reasons has made it out of the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/30/an-update-on-our-legal-troubles.html">comma he fell in</a> some time ago, and when he pulled up to the interview spot (in an undisclosed location to protect the veracity of our news services) he’d brought a friend. Or more accurately, he’d dragged a person wearing a ski mask and gloves there with him by his ears.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Biggin Mammo: “Welcome, welcome. I see you’ve brought someone with you.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Josgot Rhobbed: “Not just any someone, this man’s responsible for the theft of 500 pounds!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Josgot promptly yanks the ski mask off of the other person’s face, revealing him to be <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/13/very-dear-friends-of-local-man-astonished-at-will-to-live.html">Robald Shickner</a>. Biggin Mammo is undoubtedly surprised, and flickers of PTSD from the comma he fell into play across his face.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald Shickner: “I’ll never confess. Never! Why I’ll—”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Ah, I see you’ve brought your weight loss coach along for the interview as well. How thoughtful, to give your mentor and guide through this journey some credit as well.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rhobbed: “What? No, this man took 500 pounds from me in the dead of night!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “So you’re saying that sleep was the key to your impressive weightloss?I’ll keep that in mind.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rhobbed: “This. Man. Robbed. Me.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shickner: “No I didn’t. I’m the weight loss coach, as you said.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “See, 2 against 1. Of course we know what happened to you better than you do. Now, Mr. Coach-guy. I could’ve sworn I’ve seen you somewhere. Have we met?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shickner: “Uhm, definitely not. No sirree. You might have seen me on RentAWeightLossCoachNoVirus.com. You certainly look like you need one.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “You’re lucky I’m in a good mood today, I’ll let you off with a warning.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>All this time, Rhobbed has been getting more and more agitated that no one is listening to the sacrifices he underwent to lose 500 pounds in just a single night (or agitated about something, at least)</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rhobbed: “Alright. If we’re done with believing that this thief is my weight loss coach and half recognizing each other, can we get back to the matter at hand. Let me spell it out for you, real-slow. I Just Got Robbed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “I Biggin Mammo.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shickner<em>(muttering)</em>: “Guess that comma knocked more out of you than I thought.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Anywho, Mr. Shickner, is it? How were you able to convince Josgot to follow your training regimen? It must have been hard, losing 500 pounds in one night.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shickner: “Oh, it sure was, but I’m sure Josgot remembers it as being as sudden as realizing that one’s wallet is no longer in their pocket. Er, if you emotionally connect with that very hypothetical example, that is.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rhobbed: “Well, I do. Because this man pickpocketed my wallet right out of my pocket at a busy street corner. Good thing my wallet’s bedazzled with razor-sharp spikes and the such, just following recent trends. I saw the things poking out of his pocket and was onto him like a heat-seeking missile.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shickner: “Well, you forgot to mention that your wallet had spikes on both sides.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>At this point, Robald Shickner winces and rubs at his thigh, as if remembering a traumatic spike-removal session</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “So basically, Coach here metaphorically grabbed those pounds off of you? I’m not sure why you’d represent body fat as a wallet, but then again it has been a while since I’ve been out and about on the streets.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Rhobbed proceeds to make several agony-filled agonizing noises and tries to strangle Mammo, then Shickner, then himself when he realizes that he lacks the hand size to wrap his hands around Mammo’s neck of considerable girth, and the strength to do much of anything to seasoned criminal Robald Shickner</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Well, now that the obligatory attack-the-interviewer part of the interview is out of the way, I’ve got a question for your coach. Are you still offering your services? How much would it cost for a reduction in, say, 500 more pounds?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shickner: “About $679.44 USD. Or 50 shimilac, whichever you prefer.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Great! Wherever do you find deals like these, Rhobbed?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rhobbed<em>(in a defeated sort of way)</em>: “<del>from the black market</del> I dunno man they just kind of skulk up behind me and try to swindle me out of the fruits of my labor.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Well I wouldn’t really call it the fruits of your labor. Maybe the doughnuts of your labor.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rhobbed: “I give up.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Josgot Rhobbed then uncharacteristically dove out of the window. This wasn’t the window that Robald and his brother Jonas had doven through some months prior (which was never fixed), but instead a brand new, just-asking-for-it pane of glass. Welp, there goes our electricity budget. Biggin Mammo was left along with Robald Shickner, and apparently all it took was someone diving out of a window to trigger his previous PTSD. Into another comma he falls. We’ve really got to be careful where we leave those commas lying around. They are very sharp, especially on the bottom end. Robald, like the experienced window-diver he was, elected to use the first hole he and his brother’d made that day, and got away scot-free.</p>

<p>It sure is a mystery how Josgot Rhobbed lost all those pounds so quickly. Although the miracle power (and agile fingers) of Robald Shickner may have had a role in it. I hear after hearing Josgot’s story, though, people all over the world are alternately buying duct tape bands for their wallets and hiring Shickner to help them lose their excess body fat.</p>

<hr />
<p>When he realized that he had lost so much weight so quickly, Rhobbed immediately contacted a local police station about the loss of 500 pounds. This isn’t the right way to do report your weight-loss success story, sadly. While we do have contacts inside the law enforcement system (and <em>everywhere</em> else), it just is a hassle. If anything newsworthy (or anything at all) happens to you, be sure to immediately contact the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO7XPD8xGt_rdGOtJ6u8yvHwD1soTwJ_64jk5kr59cf3bfdw/viewform?usp=sf_link">Hecrenews Article Tip Line</a> so that the best, most veracious news source out there can spread the word.</p>

<p>Wopps out.</p>

    <title>Alarming: Nearby Water Sources reach near-boiling levels</title>

    <description>An article about Alarming: Nearby Water Sources reach near-boiling levels</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people assume that their local water sources are always constant and unchanging. It takes someone who really cares about the environment to go out there and make sure that nearby rivers and streams are pollution-free and performing at normal levels. And that someone is Wah Turtistin. For years now, Turtistin has been testing water sources around his town, namely the Goorlicker stream. On the first Tuesday of every month, Turtistin makes his pilgrimage down to the banks of the mighty Goorlicker along with his briefcase of chemicals and concoctions, in order to measure factors such as temperature, pH, floating fast food cups, and a couple other very-useful metrics.</p>

<p>Wah Turtistin got his start in the wa tertesting business a long time ago, through a really unfortunate baggage claim mix-up. Him and a sketchy stranger in a trench coat somehow had the same suitcase, and as a result of him picking up the stranger’s case in baggage claim, Turtistin got access to various bottles and powders that were found in the suitcase. He was instantly hooked (to the idea of scientific experimentation, not to the powders themselves). It did cost him an entire suitcase worth of underpants, but Turtistin tells us it was well worth it.</p>

<p>Using his newfound testing kit (despite not knowing what the testing kit was for, or how to use it), Turtistin dove headfirst (not literally) into testing the quality of nearby water sources. His autodidactic approach to wa tertesting seemed to go well. On his first time, Turtistin recalls kneeling down at the banks of the Good ol’ Goorlicker and basically just throwing assorted pinches of his handy-dandy not-at-all-druggy batch of powders and tinctures.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Experimentation is the key to something. But where is the lock?” - <em>Wah Turtistin, c. 2021</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, Turtistin seemed to have gotten the inspiration to become a citizen scientist at the perfect time. A couple weeks after his first water testing, local scientists at the National Emporium for Wa Tertesting began reporting significant levels of illicit substances in the Goorlicker stream, namely <strong>justice</strong> and jocose. They are still on the hunt for the source of these dumps, which for some reason spike on the first Tuesday of every month. Good luck to them.</p>

<p>Anyways, soon Turtistin had had enough of just measuring how much powder he could dump in the stream without being busted by the fuzz. It was time to move on to some <em>actual</em> data. By <em>commandeering</em> a rusty thermometer originally meant for one’s no no square, Turtistin had unlocked a brand new metric of water quality: temperature. Below is an image of Wah Turtistin’s thermometer, to spur the imagination and all that.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/thermometer.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After profusely apologizing to the no no square he pulled the thermometer out from, Turtstin got down to work. He made his now habitual trek to the Goorlicker, and neared the bank, dipping his toes in to keep them cool. After plunging the thermometer in, he was shocked. The temperature values were skyrocketing, almost up to 90 degrees! Given that he knew water boils at 100, Turtistin was correctly and noticeably alarmed. He quickly withdrew his toes so that they wouldn’t be boiled off and ran like mad to the nearest individual he could spot to tell them the news (without taking off their pants, that would just be weird). That nearest individual happened to be our very own somewhat-beloved SAR head (metaphorically speaking).</p>

<p>But what to make of these all-together alarming results? Sheeple Dunnell (or is it <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/10/04/abundance-of-negative-mass-leads-top-scientists-to-question-the-existence-of-gummy-worms.html">Dunnel</a>?) says that there isn’t anything to worry about. Dunnell/Dunnel is very passionate about the environment and water quality, and is even affiliated with Snaxachusetts Stream Team. Using rather more colorful language (redacted for the reader’s sanity), Dunnell described Wah Turtstin’s operations as “incredibly [unscientific]”, and the “[slightly not upstanding individual] must be [a little confused], and shouldn’t have even [no non-graphic translation available].” Quite emotional, for the nerdy, sciencey type that Dunnell/Dunnel usually is. Whatever his last name may be, he brings an interesting counterpoint to the new findings. You know what they say, haters gonna hate.</p>

<hr />

<p>Wah Turtistin’s efforts have spurred him onto collecting even more data types, including pH and a count of the fast food cups floating in the stream. But the question raised by his findings remains to be conclusively answered. Will we ever truly find out if our water sources are boiling, or if they’ve just been the normal temperature all along? Guess we’ll never know. If my good auld grandfather had anything to say about this situation, it would be, and I quote: “rat-a-tat-tat-tat”.</p>

    <title>Abundance of Negative Mass Leads top Scientists to Question the Existence of Gummy Worms</title>

    <description>An article about Abundance of Negative Mass Leads top Scientists to Question the Existence of Gummy Worms</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was just a regular Thursday evening for the SAR team at the Hecrenews. Another day of not finishing any of the incoming papers that infinitely pile (who knows
what those papers are even about, and that’s super inefficient since they have technology), gossipping, and lazing about. This was until the red light on the central
dashboard, a strange apparatus (they could have easily ordered something that looks way better but <em>someone</em> was insistent on building it themselves) that looks
like it will fall apart any second, yet has lasted a whopping 5 years, turned on. A few seconds later, all the secondary warning lights were on, and an alarm even
went off. That alarm was one of the SAR member’s alarm to wake up from their 2 hour nap in the middle of work, but it added to the stress in the room. There was a
disturbance in the universe. Sheeple Dunnell (or is it Dunnel?) burst into the room, which was strange as he was supposedly ‘busy’ with matters outside the SAR
office so he shouldn’t have gotten there so fast, and was surprised to see the SAR team somewhat functioning. Of course, there was only one meaning behind this, a
disturbance in the universe, not again…</p>

<p>In no less than 30 minutes after the lights turned red, Dunnell/Dunnel recieved a text on his, very secure, black berry phone. Soon after he got another text, and then
another, and yet another. One foolish SAR team remarked, “Dang, Dunnell’s skipping out on his date and now his girl is mad,” and Dunnell/Dunnel gave that member a look
that had such a great effect the poor guy became paralyzed for the rest of the day. Dunnel was getting 1000s of messages from labs around the world all conducting
some sort of experiments with mass and obtaining negative masses. This is a problem. Mass is matter, why does it matter? Well, because it exists! If an object has no
matter, it has no atoms, so it doesn’t exist. Take that ideal strings, springs, and etc.! The question is, how can you have something less than nothing? This is an
interesting question and my feeble brain does not have enough brain cells to give a proper answer. Does negative mass cancel out mass? How did the scientists even
record this? These are all mystery implementation details that I don’t want to go outside, walk around, and question people about so I will just leave it as a mystery.</p>

<p>Sheeple Dunnell hypothesizes the increased quantities of negative mass being due to the influx of Datil, Jocose, and Jolly Juice affected the matrix field. He determined
this using the equations system, and I really have no clue what any of this means. There is one question my limited IQ was able to grasp, and that is Dunnel mentioned
an increase of negative mass, that implies negative mass was already there to begin with. A hole has opened up in the Hecresphere, and strange substances are flowing
in from the Alternate Universe, the prominent figure being negative mass. SAR would be giddy and full of bliss to spend their days researching negative mass, but since
we are still wating on that <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/05/datil-discovered.html">Datil report</a> I can say without a doubt that that’s not
happening anytime soon.</p>

<p>The big question being asked about negative mass, is the existence of gummy worms. How are these two related, I don’t know, but that’s what the top scientists are
asking questions about. This implies some relationship between negative mass and the existence of gummy worms. What exactly are gummy worms? They are a candy/sweet
made out of gelatin, which is why they are gummy, and they are in the shape of a worm, making them a gummy worm. What is the purpose of this? Worms are for birds, and
not just any birds, but early birds. Why do we need to eat worms, we don’t because they’re gross, but gummy worms are okay. It must be related to gummy bears but
the scientists seem ok with that. I couldn’t talk to any of these scientists becaues they were so absorbed with figuring out why gummy worms exist that they wouldn’t
reply to my emails. Maybe we’ll soon be finding out why gummy worms exist, and that could be a stepping stone to us understanding what negative mass truly is. This

    <title>The Jocose Gang</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/09/06/the-jocose-gang.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/09/06/the-jocose-gang.html</guid>
    <description>An article about The Jocose Gang</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Problems in Pucallpa: The Jocose Gang</p>

<p>Undergound activies have been bussin in Peru (the boss said try using the word “bussin” in an article, hope I did it right) even since the 1950s, but this is a notable
and new threat. The Jocose Gang, also referred to as the Jocose Joint, has been the number one perpetrator of underground illegal criminal activities. The authorities
cannot get their hands on them; they are truly a fearsome bunch. What is Jocose? What is the Jocose Joint? How are we going to be safe? No need to fear because Pablo
has got you covered.</p>

<p>There is a new era of substances. The big three to be on the lookout for are <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/05/datil-discovered.html">datil</a>,
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/03/secret-to-silky-smooth-hair.html">jolly juice</a>, and jocose. The denotation of jocose is</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Playful or humorous”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but the Jocose Joint deals with a jocose that is definitely not this. In fact, the Jocose Joint currently have a monopoly on jocose so nobody except for them really
know what it is. I have taken the risks to find as much information as I could, and all I could find out was that there is a substance that they call jocose. Not only
can they escape the authorities, but they can escape a Hecrenews Journalist!</p>

<p>While we do not know much about the identities of the Jocose Joint, we do know some prominent members. One is the Jocose Joint, the same name as the gang! The Jocose
Joint is probably the leader of the Jocose Joint, but it’s all just speculation (but plausible speculation). Next up we know about the Jocose Bandit. Presumably they
steal jocose, but since they have all the jocose I guess they won’t need to steal it? Maybe the Jocose Bandit steals other things, or maybe nobody can access jocose
because the Jocose Bandit takes it back. Who knows what the Jocose Bandit truly does, but they sure are a force of nature. There is the Jocose Junkie, a man who has
lost it all to jocose, they probably lead a jocose cult and spend most of their time with jocose. We just know that while all other junkies have gone mad, this junkie
is more than jiving. The strongest out of the bunch is the Jocose Hitman. The Jocose Hitman gets the job done. Any target will be eliminated without fail. If you find
the Jocose Hitman is on your tail, it’s already too late. There is the Jocose Inspector. No one knows what the Inspector inspects. The quality of the jocose, the
transcations of jocose, or some other nefarious activity needing inspection, but the Jocose Inspector will quality check it all! The last two currently known members
of the Jocose Joint go hand in hand. Brothers in arms, the are the Jocose Producer and the Jocose Farmer. One producers jocose and the other farms it. What is the
difference? Well there is such a difference that there are two members for two seperate things! Unfortunately, we know the hierarchy of the Jocose Joint is vast and
there exists many more members than the ones I have discussed. Through all of my scouring of information, I got suttle clues and deduced this information, but I know
how little I know, the Joint is much bigger.</p>

<p>On the bright side, the Jocose Joint does not mess with you if you do not mess with them. Pucallpa is still a great place to visit, just don’t get into any trouble, stay
on the right path, and the Jocose Joint will not be after you. I have asked my fellow friends to keep a lookout and send me any information they get on the Jocose Joint
and I will make sure that you guys are updated. Do not panic, the Jocose Joint is not after you, and you should be fine.</p>

    <title>How to tell if your Pillow is Actually a Duck</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/07/27/how-to-tell-if-your-pillow-is-actually-a-duck.html</link>

    <description>An article about How to tell if your Pillow is Actually a Duck</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Salutations, dear loyal hecrenews readers. Today, we’ll discuss a topic that seems to be plaguing the community as of late: How to tell if your pillow is actually a duck. Now, you might be thinking something along the lines of: “Foolboy, of course I know my pillow isn’t a duck! What do you take me for, a MEL?” but I assure you, this very real problem is really very problematic. Take a good, long look at your pillow right now. Is it a pillow, or just  a “pillow” masquerading as a duck? Can you even tell the difference?? This is why, for the good of humankind as a whole, I’ve decided to write up a handy-dandy guide for all your pillow and duck differentiating needs.</p>

<p>Take your average pillow(pictured below). Pretty white, right? That’s assuming you haven’t gone and salsa’d it up, of course. Barring that unfortunate case, most pillows are white indeed. Now, if you have a pillow nearby, pick it up. Isn’t it fluffy? Now throw it away from you like it’s infested with bedbugs. Listen to the sound it makes when it hits the ground. Just a dull thump, no echo at all. And we’ve touched on the three main qualities of a pillow: It’s white, it’s fluffy, and it doesn’t echo when it hits the ground.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/pillow.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let’s compare these qualities to those of a duck. Pillows are white, so are many ducks. In fact, the big man at our SAR (Science and Research) Division, Sheeple Dunnell, said that “ducks are fluffy” as well. Starting to see a problem here? Well, it only gets worse. We already know that a pillow doesn’t echo when you try to amke a sound with it, but surely this doesn’t extend for a duck. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. When a mysterious figure only known as “The Don” was asked about this in one of the routine street <del>interrogations</del>interviews regularly conducted by hecrenews staff, he replied very enigmatically, “Why a dck’s quack doesn’t echo? No one knows…” Somehow he managed to say the ellipsis, which is a god-tier superpower in and of itself. But more pressing is that ducks have managed to demonstrate the same qualities as pillows. They’re 3 for 3 now. What a calamity!</p>

<p>We’ve got to get to the real essence of pilows and ducks here, then, if we want to differentiate the two. The only surefire way to tell them apart, based on our data, is the taste test. Yes, you heard us right. Through a whole bunch of wholly scientific experimentation, the boys at SAR have discovered that pillows taste like “yuck”, while ducks taste like “duck”. Additionally, if you try taking a bite out of a pillow it just sits there, while if you try taking a bite out of a  duck it goes ballistic, putting 3-5 good nerds in the hospital with in some cases incurable physical and mental damage.</p>

<p>At least the pillow vs. duck debate is finally settled. Millions of people can now safely go to sleep, knowing their head rests upon a white, fluffy, non-echoing pillow instead of a white, fluffy, non-echoing duck. Make sure to take a bite first, just to be sure!</p>

<hr />
<p>In unrelated news, SAR has a vacancy of about 3-5 people currently, all takers are welcome. Employees can be expected to talk sciencey, engage in whatever random scientific pursuits we tell them to, and generally support the HBA in its endeavors as well. (When you show up to the interview, the secret code is “rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat-ta</p>

<p>Edit by HAC (Hecrenews Article Quality Control): Hector is trying to secretly foist his nonvegetarian ideals onto you in this article, be warned. The hecrenews does not publicly endorse either dietary preference. You do not have to take a bite out of your pillow/duck if you do not wish. Ignorance is bliss.</p>

    <title>In a World Full of Pants, Man Struggles to Find Pant</title>

    <description>An article about In a World Full of Pants, Man Struggles to Find Pant</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here in the depths of Peru a man faces a great challenge. Jean Bule is on the search for a pant, but is only able to find pants. Throughout all the jeans and
sweatpants, Bule is not able to find a single pant, they always come in pairs. Bule has been roaming the streets of Puno for a couple of months now, and we are
excited to get a live interview with him. Bule doesn’t want to buy a pair of pants and cut them in half. He doesn’t need two pants, so creating an extra would be
a waste, and Bule doesn’t want to pay the steep extra Sol for another pair. There were many hot days, long walks, countless talking to countless store owners, and
Bule could not find a single pant.</p>

<h1 id="interview">Interview</h1>

<p>“Hello Bule. I am Pablo, a Hecrenews author. Thank you for allowing this interview to happen, we are so excited about this opportunity.”</p>

<p>“No problembo, what questions do you got for me?”</p>

<p>“First we got to know, what is a singular pant? Why is it a pair of pants and why do you need a singular pant?”</p>

<p>“You see, it all has to do with how society has changed. You see, in the beginning there were pantaloons. They wre actually two things you put on. You put on one
leg, tie it around your waist, then put on the other one. In our current age, pants are manufactured as one piece of clothing, and this is great. I personally love
this, but there is a problem. We lack customization. We lack mixing and matching. Why do we have to settle for what we have. Mixing up pants to create a pair of
pants will make our society more expressive and more colorful. I think it’s a necessary change. At first people will think it’s dumb and crazy, but that is always the
case for new trends. After time, I’m certain everyone will be mixing and matching pants to create the perfect pair for the day.”</p>

<p>“Wow, that’s great! Sadly, I don’t think there is a shop here in Puno that sells singular pant(s), I doubt there would be in all of Peru? So what is your plan? I don’t
think searching will help you anymore.”</p>

<p>“Well Pablo I’ve been thinking the same thing, and luckilly, I already started working on a solution. I think it’s easier if I show you.”</p>

<p>We leave the public bench and I start following Jean Bule through the streets of Puno. Soon, we reach a small shop. Bule takes me inside and I stand in shock at
the pant making factory. Bule has gathered some workers and they were manufacturing pants. Every single one had a unique pattern on it. In addition to the pants, some
people were making a unique garmet that allows you to attach the two pant(s) for easy mixing and matching. I was amazed, and they were making a lot of pant(s).</p>

<p>“I’ve started making my own pant-s. I couldn’t find any stores that have any, so I realized I needed to make that store, and be the positive change in the world that
we need. I’m certain we will be changing the future for the better.”</p>

<p>“Wow that is amazing, and I hope people reading this article check out your store. By the way, why were you only looking for one pant?”</p>

<p>“I think some things are better kept secret.”</p>

<p>And that was the end of the interview. The world we live in is a world full of pants and no pant(s), but brave people like Bule are here to fight against the world,
to make change, and make the difference. I think that is enough inspiration for now, the boss asked me to add some inspiration to the articles, not exactly sure
why, but that’s that.</p>

    <title>Getting Your Goat: A Literary Analysis</title>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/07/20/getting-your-goat.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Getting Your Goat: A Literary Analysis</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To Kill a Mockingbird. It’s just some book about some stuff, not really 100% sure myself. I think kids these days have to read it in school, so
it must be ok, I guess. But we’re a news site, not a book club, so what is this literary analysis. Well, sometimes what you don’t need is the
clickbait headlines of the breaking news, but instead some inspriation and motivation. A loyal Hecrenews reader <del>had an old literary analysis
found and stolen</del> voluntarily offered to share their literary analysis of a passage from the Mockingbird, and this is some new stuff that does
provide some good information, so I guess it qualifies as news.</p>

<p>“Let’s get into it”</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/goat_lit_analysis.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This google doc doesn’t look that big, but it sures packs a lot, so let’s unpack it. We start off with a quote.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You might hear some ugly talk about it at school, but do one thing for me if you will: you just hold your head high and keep thosoe fists down.
No matter what anybody says to you, don’t you let ‘em get your goat,” (Lee 101).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before we even start that analysis, I think we should go through this quote. There is an air of mystery, as there is ugly talk about ‘it’ at school,
but from the quote given it is hard to determine what ‘it’ exactly is. Am I going to read the book to figure it out, of course not! We’ll get back
to what ‘it’ could be in a little bit. Next up is “hold your head high and keep those fists down.” Keeping those fists down might refer to not
resorting to violence, or it could refer to just beating up people smaller than you, they would be so small that you would keep your fists down
while beating them up. I don’t really know. From the 1st half of this portion, holding your head high, this is not literally holding your head like
you are the headless horseman, but instead it means to be proud. Personally, I think beating someone with your fists down is something to be more
proud of than just resorting to non-violence. I don’t know, authors are kinda sus, they could mean anything. The last part reveals some big stuff.
“No matter what anybody says to you, don’t you let ‘em get your goat.” When a noun like goat is tossed around like this, it could mean anything,
and I mean anything. Let’s get through the talk part first. “No matter what anybody says to you,” is probably relating to that ugly talk that is
being heard at school. I think I got it. The pieces are fitting together like a detective in a show solving a case. There is a goat about to be
stolen, and people will say ugly things, probaly to lower your guard and offset your emotional state. To prevent the robbery of this goat, you
must keep your fists down, beat up the people lower than you so they can’t steal your goat and keep your head held high, so the people higher than
you would be too intimidated to steal your goat. What people say doesn’t matter, you can’t let them get your goat.</p>

<p>Wow. That was a lot, but now, we can finally analyze the analysis, and see what is going on, maybe get some more context.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The device, metaphor, is used to compare Scout’s self-confidence or free will to a goat which would symbolize what would need to be protected to maintain
social stature of a person as farmers would protect and preserve their goats and keep their stature to other farmers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think some commas are missing, as well as some words, but I’m probably wrong as I doubt our loyal Hecrenews readers can produce anything less than perfection.
“The device, metaphor.” Woo ee, that’s no electronic device, that’s a literary device. They are like electronic devices but for books, extra tools to add some
depth to a text. The device at hand is a metaphor. This compares two things, usually using one thing to represent another. A simile is more straightforward,
it compares two things using key words like like, as, so, or, or than. For example, he was fast like a cheetah is a simile because it uses like. Scout’s (Scout
is a character I assume?) self-confidence, or free will, is being compared to a goat. First of all, I’m not sure how self-confidence and free will are interchangable.
Nevertheless, they are being compared to a goat. That is the metaphor. Now, this may not make much sense at first, but the analysis tells us what the goat symbolizes.
See, I told you those nouns that they use are going to come paired up with symbolism. Goats are “what would need to be protected to maintain social stature of a person
as farmers would protect and preserve their goats and keep their stature to other farmers.” That’s a lot to unpack. First it makes a bit of sense. Nomadic farmers
would use goats as a sort of stature, or maybe it’s their currency, I would need to ask an expert on that one. Farmers would not only protect their goats, but also
preserve them! How do you preserve live livestock?? Pickling? Perhaps, who knows for sure. Anywho, farmers need their goats to keep their social status relative to
other farmers, we can roll with that. Scout’s confidence or free-will is the goat, it needs to be preserved so Scout can keep her status in the community, whether it’s
relative to farmers or just other people is unknown. If Scout keeps her fists down and doesn’t mind the ugly talk at school, they will not ruin Scout’s goat, or her
free will. No matter what anybody says, Scout should keep her goat, her self-confidence.</p>

<p>Man, what an analysis, maybe we should do this kind of thing more often. Well now we need to talk about the big things, how do you get your goat? Well, there are many
ways you can secure your goat. For one, make your bed in the morning. That way, no matter how bad your day has been, you can end the day knowing you have a nice bed
to sleep on. Wake up early, don’t waste a bunch of time on social media, watching random YouTube videos, or doing work or schoolwork the hours before you sleep, and
sleep well. One thing to note, I am not a motivational speaker, I am a journalist, and if you want the expert advice on motivaion, energy, and life, then check out
<a href="https://melnewzers.blogspot.com/">this blog</a>. Just now I was talking about getting your goat in life, but life is big and complex so it’s a lot to focus on. It may
be best to procure your goat in other places. Maybe aim smaller, if you’re playing a video game, get your goat in that. Figure out the mindset, the strategies, and
have fun, but win and get that goat. If you become a master of getting your goat, I assure you you will be going places.</p>

<p>This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Tired of Topical Treatments, Man Tries Tropical Treatments</title>

    <description>An article about Tired of Topical Treatments, Man Tries Tropical Treatments</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bug bites, acne, pimples, and a whole order of skin problems are no stranger to helpless Golding Yate. At first it wasn’t a problem, but too many people in his life
were pointing these nightmares out and Yate needed a solution. He tried all the off-shelf remedies, all the brands, even went to the doctor for prescribed solutions,
and nothing was working. However, throughout long hours in front of Google Spreadsheets and months of data collection, Yate noticd a pattern in the data. All of the
remedies he tried had to be applied topicaly, aka applied on topic, or at least that’s what I think it means. What if instead of having a remedy that is applied
topically, there was a remedy that was applied tropically?</p>

<p>Beach relaxation, nice sunsets, coconut water, and fun times are all solutions that are applied tropically, but sometimes it’s not all about beaches and fun. The tropics
are an area of the Earth that are in betwen the tropic of Cancer and the tropic of Capricorn. Why are those lines called tropics? That’s a mystery to me, you should ask
Sheeple Dunnell/Dunnel (Which is his correct last name? I also do not know). You could be in the middle of an ocean and still be in the tropics, it is a pretty big range,
but not so big if you are a dimension travelling news-reporter. Sadly for Yate, the good old ‘sick day from work’ (aka surprise family vacation), did not cure his skin
<del>irrigations</del> irritations. It was time for Yate to discover his own treatment.</p>

<p>Yate whipped together a secret concoction of sorts, the recipie is private, only revealing enough to slide by the FDA, and it’s all natural flavours and spices, it seems.
Yate then built an intergalatic space transportation device (with the help of some friends) dubbed the InSTant D(evice). The InSTant D was used to fly over the entire tropical
area. What Yate did was pretty self-explanatory, you probably won’t even need the article. Yate used the InSTant D and sprinkled his tropical treatment all over the tropics, kind
of like Santa Claus mixed with pixie dust. For the ground onlookers, they thought it was a UFO and claimed aliens built the pyramids, and said people were reported to see a ghost
like figure of angry pharohs and their <del>slaves</del> workers, they were probably cursed. Hopefully the get past anubis okay. After its first, and last, flight, Yate scrapped the
InSTant D to keep the parts to use for a future project, after making the InSTant D he got into engineering and locomotion design, and may pursue that as his new career. We know
that it’s never too late to start, remember, Adalbert Bulstrode <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/11/changing-clock-time-does-not-allow-you-to-time-travel.html">was a fool</a>
but through hard work become such a great physician, I mean physicist that he invented time travel and is stuck in the fabric of space time as he risked his life to save humanity, or at
least myself and the students from Leafblower Elementary.</p>

<p>But did this tropical treatment work? A resounding yes from Golding Yate. Yate no longer has a <del>shingle</del> single skin problem, and we have his (in)genius to thank for that. Yate says,
“It’s not about the end result, but the journey.” He really enjoyed his ‘sick days from work,’ as he experienced amazing views of nature while ‘having extreme fever.’ Will his boss fire
him? Probably not, but Yate is looking like he’ll secure a new job anywho. What have we learned today? Tropical treatments may be better than topical treatments. Now how are they applied
to a topic, or are they applied on topic? This conundrum will cause me many sleepless nights, but for now this has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Alpacas or Llamas</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/07/08/alpaca-or-llamas.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/07/08/alpaca-or-llamas.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Alpacas or Llamas</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is time to settle the debate, alpacas, or llamas?</p>

<p>First off, what are these two?</p>

<p>Here is an alpaca
<img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/alpaca.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here is a llama
<img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/llama.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Both can be found in Peru, and are part of Camelidae, the camel family. It may not jump out to you immediately, but camels are part of camelidae as well, making camels
the alpaca/llama of Africa and Asia. There are four lamoid species: alpaca, llama, vicuña, and guanaco. All four can mix and combine to create offspring, it’s like
a mix and match burrito deal! Here we are not going to set aside their differences, but instead bring up their differences to determine who is the best lamoid.</p>

<h1 id="size">Size</h1>
<p>Llamas are bigger, and that’s pretty much the end of the story there. Not only are llamas bigger than alpacas, but llamas are the biggest lamoid of the bunch,
deserving bonus points! Looks like llamas got a lead in this one.</p>

<h1 id="face">Face</h1>
<p>Alpacas have smaller, more blunt faces with short ears. Llamas have more elongated faces with ears the size of bananas! Judging someone by their face isn’t really
fair, so I’m told in a situation like this you guys can discuss in the comments below to see which lamoid has the better face.</p>

<h1 id="hair">Hair</h1>
<p>Alpacas have shaggy, big, fluffy hair that can be used for fleece, and they come in many fun colours such as white, yellow, brown, and black. Llama wool is simply
considered inferior. Looks like alpacas are combing back into the game.</p>

<h1 id="behavior">Behavior</h1>
<p>Llamas can carry a lot. 45 to 60kg for up to 30km every day. That is brute strength that your poor Pablo here can never manage to pull off. However, at there is a
cost. Llamas like to complain a lot. I’ve seen it live in action. If you overwork them, or treat them badly, llamas will spit, kick, lie down, and/or refuse to
move. However, this is only when you push them to their limits, since otherwise they are pretty tame. Alpacas are more timid and like to stay with their herd.
However, here is the real kicker. Llamas can be used as guard animals for livestock like alpacas and sheep. Llamas are guarding the alpacas! I think this alone
proves their dominance, even more so the fact that alpaca need to be guarded like sheep. Can you believe it, alpaca are like sheep! I think the debate here is over,
llamas are a clear winner.</p>

<p>However, new discoveries happen all the time. I wouldn’t be surprised if a researcher found a groundbreaking fact that makes llamas insignificant to alpacas, but for
now, llamas are clearly the GOAT. You can count on your friendly neighborhood Pablo to keep you updated on the things hip and happening in Peru. You may have noticed
I didn’t call in SAR, our resarch team here at the Hecrenews, well don’t worry, because when in Peru, you just have pure knowledge of these things, it is essential
to the way of life. Anywho, did you agree or disagree?</p>

    <title>Another Victory for Hecrenews: Rival Newsite Loses by Default</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/07/06/rival-newsite-loses-by-default.html</link>

    <description>An article about Another Victory for Hecrenews: Rival Newsite Loses by Default</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello hello, it’s ya boi Mister Mjir popping in for another one. Yes it’s been a while but things at out Hecrenews branch have been quite busy, so I didn’t get time
to really dig down deep into a story and produce an article about it. Anyways, here’s the scoop.</p>

<p>You may remember we were dealing with a rival newsite problem. Unlike many other fake news site and news companies that spam ads and clickbait articles, this newsite
was legit, and of the same caliber. Welp, no point in beating around the bush, let’s cut to the chase. <a href="https://melnewzers.blogspot.com/">MELnewzers</a> is the rival
newsite we were dealing with. We already had spies infiltrating their ranks- I think Wopps knows more if he wants to do a follow up article -and we were keeping them
at bay. MEL stands for Motivation, Energy, and Life, or something along those lines, I don’t really know as the information is not easily accessible. These guys
were pumping out motivational articles about famous people, and life tips and tricks to help you succeed. Is this really news? Who knows, but it’s 100% MEL. This
site was doing so well, so what went wrong?</p>

<p>I suspect their to be a simple cause. Notice in the current day, the left sidebar on the MELnewzers site says the ominous acronym, “VEC.” I have seen so many
acronyms throughout my time I don’t even know if I have storage for any more. The handy-dandy sidebar indicates VEC means volunteering and education. These don’t
follow typical HBA acronym naming guidelines, as none of the letters of the acronym in the full name are capitalized. Since there are no parenthesis we can assume
there are no implied letters, there is one “v” so that’s capitalized. The “e” is tricky, I personally think you can’t choose between the two “e”s in volunteering,
as they are right next to each other, so I will take the liberty of assuming the “e” in education is the 2nd letter in VEC. The C has to come after that e, and there
is a c in education and club, and I really can’t figure out what is what. Below the VEC icon it says VEC Club, in which case club is not part of the acronym, but the
blurb indicates VEC means volnteering and education club. Does VEC mean “volunteering and education” club or “volunteering and education club” club? I am so bamboozled.
I’m gonna go with Volunteering EduCation Club, let us know what you guys think in the comments below, we do read all of them! Digging into VEC a little more, it turns
out VEC has their own website and social media accounts. I’ll leave the further digging to you, loyal Hecrenews reader. It looks like VEC has purchased or acquired
MELnewzers in one way or another, and MELnewzers has stopped posting articles/blogs since, maybe. Idk tbh.</p>

<p>MELnewzers hasn’t posted since February 16th, 2021, promising one or two posts weekly starting the week after said week. This has not happened. What has VEC done to
MELnewzers? Who knows, but what we do know with the lack of articles is that MELnewzers is no longer a Hecrenews competitor, which is why we are finally revealing the
name to our rival news site. The only thing I can really say is this is mad sus, and I’ve seen a lot of strange things in my time. It should further be noted, that the
articles by Wopps featuring the notorious Monkey Beater have been posted on the MELnewzers blog, but currently are not available, they must have been shutting Monkey
Beater down (which is good, no qualms with that). Winning by default is not the most exhilirating thing, but I think it captures the spirit of our team the most.</p>

<p>Well it looks like this is the time for me the wrap up this article. When is the next article coming out? I have no clue. What I do know is this has been Mister Mjir,
popping in and now popping out!</p>

    <title>Safety Seal Malfunction: 15 Reported Attacked by Drunk Ferrets</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/07/04/safety-seal-malfunction-fifteen-reported-attacked-by-drunk-ferrets.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/07/04/safety-seal-malfunction-fifteen-reported-attacked-by-drunk-ferrets.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Safety Seal Malfunction: 15 Reported Attacked by Drunk Ferrets</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Safety Seals. You know them, you love them, let’s talk about them! We know there’s a whole assortment of fun safety seals, and their main function is to ensure the
item you are opening has not been opened before. Quite an ingenius invention, it took the packaging industry by storm during its inception! We have safety seals
on decks of cards, to know they’re brand new, we have safety seals on bottles, so you can trust that the bottle of substance you are purchasing is fresh of the shelf!
Sometimes safety seals even have some variations, just as the safety ‘bubbles’ on the lids of some food items, like pasta suace. Safety seals play an imporant role in
our society. They let us know things are legit, and ensure we are getting new things, not hand-me-downs. In fact, I would say the society we live in today could not
function without safety seals, and that’s why a safety seal malfunction was so devastating.</p>

<p>A business of ferrets were roaming around Chiclayo, and normally they wouldn’t attack people but not today. A local soda company’s safety seals, which were outsourced
to another company, had a major malfunction. Apparently, because of global warming, the safety seal manufacturer had to change the raw materials needed to make the
safety seals, and the new materials were ineffective, because they were so flimsy. The soda company had the keep the safety seal company anonymous, so I was not able
to conduct a further interview. The ferrets walzted into a store and opened up a few cans of soda and drank them. The store owner was in a different room at the time,
but remembers some rattling occuring at the time. The ferrets got drunk on this soda, and apparently it was some experimental soda for a special client, and not for
the general public, much less a random business of ferrets.</p>

<p>This was only the beginning of the safety seal problems, a further investigation concludes. Safetly seals for various products all over the market were failing, and
the ferrets attacked the owners of those items, it was a strange occurence for sure. One person had a vacuum cleaner box, and the safety seal was not working at all.
The vacuum cleaner could’ve fallen out of the box and rolled out of the car on the way home, that would’ve been dangerous, but the ferrets definetely topped that.
The vacuum cleaner owner preferred to remain anonymous, but I can report he had multiple scratches on his face and arms, and a shattered broom. I am not a ferret
fighting guru, but I don’t think brooms will be effective against a whole business of them. The other 14 stories were similiar, but they all had different items,
ranging from a <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/09/man-invents-device-that-turns-traffic-light-from-red-to-green.html">traffic controlling device</a>
to an 870 watt industrial blast furnace, 18 metres, model ARE4004 with side drawers.</p>

<p>How were the ferrets stopped? They weren’t. They are continuing to roam the streets of Peru to this day! They are probably sober by this time, and let me tell you from
experience sober ferrets are far better than drunk ferrets. Didn’t know soda could get them drunk, well it was also surprising that squirrels could get drunk from
moldy coconuts, so I don’t know what to expect from animals anymore. For the people in the streets of Chiclayo, watch out for a business of ferrets, and make sure
your safety seals are class A rated or better.</p>

    <title>New Speedreading Tactics to Replace the Old</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/06/09/new-speedreading-tactics-to-replace-the-old.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/06/09/new-speedreading-tactics-to-replace-the-old.html</guid>
    <description>An article about New Speedreading Tactics to Replace the Old</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost a year ago, Valtteri Eva changed the face of the speedreading game with his novel, 500, no, 1000000000 IQ plays. He took to the video
game speedrunning community, the fastest people on the face of the planet, and figured out how to reduce reading time by magnitudes by
extrapolating. If you missed out on the great exploits of Eva, which will go down in history forever, you can find them
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/29/man-wins-speedreading-competition-with-new-technique.html">here</a>. As with
speedrunning, Eva’s fame did not last for too long, as new players enetered the game to continue finding better tactics to surpass even Eva.</p>

<h2 id="the-tactics">The tactics</h2>
<p>The new tactics that have entered the game are diving, judge-extortion, and eidetic memory, and these are the three major technqiues, the
top speed readers use. To review on what speed reading is, it is a intergalatical competition, run by some fancy people, maybe these older
and experienced Hecrenews authors know but not your friendly neighborhood person Pablo, sorry guys. Participants must climb up the ranks
by participating in rounds, which are judged by multiple judges. There are two sections in a round, first a person must read the whole book,
if they chose to do so. There is a nuance in the rules where really you just need to declare that you are done. Afterwards you are not
allowed to look at the book and must wait for the second section. The second section is a comprehension section. The judges ask questions
about the book and the participant must answer the questions correctly. Whoever get more questions right wins the round, if there is a tie,
it is based on who finished the book faster. (There are multiple books per round, you must read all of them, and then answer questions
about all of them)</p>

<h2 id="what-is-extrapolation">What is extrapolation</h2>
<p>Extrapolation is exptrapolating what is on the book while reading this. Eva was the pioneer in this strategy and used it as a major
timeskip, stunning the other competitors. It is not skipping the book, but more like writing it yourself giving a few words. You figure
out the rest of the words given a certain amount of words, just like extrapolating in your science class. (Remember to extrapolate, do not
fabricate)</p>

<h2 id="divining">Divining</h2>
<p>Divining is one of the greatest techniques out there. I honestly don’t know how this works. The people just know the book, the answers
just seep into their brains. They are forces of nature, they are unstoppable, would I mess with them? Probably not. I don’t know how
people train for this, but most of the users of this method are usually able to predict the future as well. Do they ask a higher being
for assistance? I do not know, but I do know that they get results. Diviners get things done.</p>

<h2 id="judge-extortion">Judge-Extortion</h2>
<p>Why read the book anyways, reading is for nerds, is the best way to describe judge extortion. There are many ways to extort a judge.
This is a complex strategy involving psychology, economy, mind games, hijinks, bamboozling, and more fancy words, everything except
for doing anything with the book. At the lower levels, where there is less regulation, bribing a judge is easy. However, as you start to
move up the ranks, it gets increasingly difficult to bribe the judge. Once you get past your country, if your planet does not have a
worldwide currency, simply money may not be enough to bribe all the judges, and this strategy is most effective if all the judges
are bribed. The galactical level is beyond me, I’ve never been there so I don’t even know what kind of currency you would need to bribe
those judges, rare space material?? Although controversial, the main claim seems to be integrity and honesty and honor and pride and that
business, this strategy has had widespread success, especially with those who cannot divine the answers. In some ways it’s better, because
why even try and read when you can just pay to win?!</p>

<h2 id="eidetic-memory">Eidetic Memory</h2>
<p>Photographic memory, eidetic memory, same thing, but eidetic sounds fancier. You may be thinking, how can these compete at the higher
levels, divining looks like it will crush this technique. However, divining takes a bit of time to work, although waaaaay less than
actually reading the book. With eidetic memory, competitors can just flip through the pages of all the books. There are many book
flipping techniques dervied from them (note book flipping refers to flipping the pages of the book, not flipping the actual book).
The tricky part for edietic memory people is they must also be geniuses. Sometimes, the questions are in their favor, asking for a specific
detail or asking what’s the nth word on page 56, but sometimes its a comprehension question. To optimize their memory, they must be
comprehending the book at the same time they are memorizing the pages, and that’s some crazy stuff if you ask me! These are the
super-geniuses of the bunch, and pretty rare, however common amongst the cream of the crop speedreaders. You know, I have photographic
memory too, I take out my cell phone, snap a picture, and that’s a photo my phone will remember, photographic memory, never fails.</p>

<p>There are new techniques being created as I write this article. The most prominent game changer I see is super-extrapolation. This is
leagues above extrapolation, the user extrapolates the entire book given only its title. I can’t even begin to fathom how these people
will do it, but if speedreading gains traction where I’m from (Peru by the way), the whole foundation of society will be shook, I might
have to venture to find where the other Hecrenews journalists are, I don’t think they’re from my planet, much less from Peru.</p>

<p>Well, these people are constantly changing the game of speedreading, and while Eva’s strategy of extrapolation may be collecting dust, we
can never forget that he is the father of speedreading techniques. He took an uninteresting competition, and made so many more people
interested in it. He has truly done great things for the speedreading community, and the super-extrapolaters plan to upgrade the
extrapolation technique and restore its former glory.</p>

    <description>An article about Reputable News Source Pulls Epic April Fools Prank</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This just in. Reputable news source, the Hecrenews, has pulled a massive April Fools prank on its loyal readers. What prank would be so epic? Well, recently, the
Hecrenews hasn’t been posting many articles, and that’s the prank! Can you believe it! Only one article in January and one in February, you can’t get any lower! In
fact, skeptics speculate there were also no articles in March, but only time will tell. Many a time has the Hecrenews had a lack of news. Once it was simple laziness,
once it was an inability to find anything interesting, and once it was problems with the management. The management does seem to be a lot better than what it has
reported to be, there have been 0 reports to HR these past few months, and that’s a 420% decrease! I really do wonder how they manage this, probably being ‘run by the
HBA’ is what gets everyone by. Do they even pay attention? Who knows. The <a href="https://hecrenet.github.io/update/2021/02/28/new-design.html">latest article on the hecrenet</a>
was from all the way back in the end of February, and that was just about the site design update (gotta say, I do love the design though). No updates on Hecrepedia
and the twitter either, what happened to the HBA? Maybe they are just so effective at weeding out the snaxii we aren’t hearing much from them, but this is still rather
disappointing.</p>

<p>Many critics are not happy with the April Fools joke. For one, it is not even April Fools anymore, critics cite laziness and calling it an April Fools joke is an
excuse to hid it- but brooo, it’s just a prank! Izrail Swanhilde, a local that we interviewd, reported “as the Hecrenews is one of few real media outlets these days,
it is the only thing I read. I read nothing else, heck, I do nothing else! When the articles stopped posting I didn’t know what to do with myself, I was going crazy,
I was driven insane. It was madness, radical, unfathomable! I was sitting in my couch, hitting refresh 24-7 in hopes of a new article. Thank goodness Wopps posted one
a little over a week ago, I do not know if I can adjust to this new life style, it’s like switching from eating three full meals and around the clock snacks to just
eating one bean for the entire day’s meal. Sohrab Patrício turned to other “news” sources, such as MELnewzers, but was struggling to find that Hecrenews quality there.</p>

<p>Whether it is laziness or a prank, who knows, but we do know that the folks at Hecrenews are making big moves. Who knows what’s going to happen next?</p>

    <title>Hackers, once again, Target Mr. Dobrila</title>

    <description>An article about Hackers, once again, Target Mr. Dobrila</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Isaiah Dobrila is just always in the thick of the action! After making <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/24/man-makes-big-bucks-with-the-help-of-nigerian-prince.html">big bucks with the help of a Nigerian Prince</a> and being <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/05/email-hackers-bring-man-closer-to-everyone-in-his-contact-list.html">confronted by email hackers</a>, he once again found himself in dire straits.</p>

<p>Dobrila has been an avid player of hit online multiplayer game Skidibidibop for quite some time now. After jumping into the forest maze for what seemed like minutes but was actually a couple weeks, Dobrila was in danger of losing himself.. once again. Finding something you can get so utterly engrossed in once is uncommon enough, but twice? Guess we shouldn’t put it past Isaiah Dobrila.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, just as he was about to discover the secret behind the Big Bad Boss, Dobrila’s game stuttered. Then it froze. Then it jived, but only for a moment. And finally, it poppped. But not the game. “Working on Updates. 3% Complete. Don’t turn off your computer”. Dobrila was frantic. Did the game save? Would he lose all of his progress? Would he have to spend hours of agony in the forest maze again? He stodd there, in front of his monitor, anxiously watching the percentage go up, darkly muttering several phrases that HAC wouldn’t let me put here.</p>

<p>When the updating finally finished, Dobrila’s body was stiff for sitting in the same position for hours on end. Nevertheless, he warmed up his creaking joints, ready to get back in the thick of it, battling snaxii and splattery things in his favorite pastime. But Alas! The updates had signed him out of the skidibidibop servers! Now, this wouldn’t be a problem for the normal man, but Isaiah Dobrila is no normal man. In his rush to hop onto and start exploring the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l034nh6VtUQ">wonderous world</a> of skidibibdibop, Dobrila had just typed in gibberish as his password and hoped clicking “stay signed in” would save him. Oh boy, was he in a predicament now! All his millions from the Nigerian Prince couldn’t restore his progress. What could he do?</p>

<p>Suddenly, Dobrila’s discord dinged. In came a very unsettling message at first, but as Dobrila interacted with this hacker-type (who was last seen <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/09/29/the-resistance-trying-to-take-down-nit-flex.html">trying to take down Nit Flex</a>, wonder what happened to that story?), he realized something. He could use this! Through a sequency of cleverly manipulating messages, Dobrila got the hacker to reveal his own password to him. Genius, if I say so myself. Dobrila, armed with both his login credentials, could now successfully sink the rest of his life into playing that meaningless video game. Hooray!</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/cheeky_hacker_dms.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Above are messages sent by Dobrila and SnaxelyLeftButtock_012. Oh, how Dobrila bamboozled that man!</p>

<hr />
<p>And there goes another happy ending. Don’t you love it!</p>

<p>Whew, it’s been a while. Don’t expect this to last. Wopps out.</p>

    <title>Cars Gain Ability to Text While Drivers Talk</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/02/18/cars-gain-ability-to-text-while-drivers-talk.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/02/18/cars-gain-ability-to-text-while-drivers-talk.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Cars Gain Ability to Text While Drivers Talk</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many years, drivers have been restricted to the conditions of being unable to talk and text now. They have to drive now and talk and text later, it only allows for
more safety and less accidents, and drivers are beginning to hate driving. What is driving without being able to talk and text. While the future seemed bleak for these
drivers, something strange, unique, revolutionary happened. Cars developed a somewhat pseudo-symbiotic relationship with the drivers, and now they are able to work
together towards the same goal.</p>

<p>One of the first things achieved with the new ability cars gained was the ability for cars to text. The signs on the street only prevent talking and texting, but cars
are smarter than they look and used some boolean logic and algebra to determine that if the drivers are takling OR texting, they won’t be talking AND texting, and
that’s the trick. Drivers can talk all they want, while they’re ever so loyal cars do the texting. The productivity some people experienced this was insane. Tovah Siti
was able to communicate with 34x times as many people, she was able to finish all of the company’s hard labor on the drive to work, and was able to just fool around
during work, but is slated for rapid promotion. Quintilian Najm was able to meet everyone in the city, and won the local race for some governmental position we
don’t really know! Some concerns arise about cars texting. If cars text another car, does it count as the drivers texting? Do the cars have a mind of their own? Is this
ethical? Sustainable? Conservational? Conversational? Those are the big questions we will try to answer, so we sought the man with the answers, a disicple of the
man of destiny: Brian Jones. We contacted Ulisses from a
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/11/10/airplanes-have-strange-ability-to-fly.html">previous article</a> to see if she knew any car mechanics. The pilot was
very insightful, so we thought a car mechanic could also help. Luckilly for us she knew just the right person.</p>

<p>Nathalie Arachne. A mechanical genius since she was 3 years old. Able to disassemble clocks, microwaves, vacuum cleaners, and resassemble them within seconds. However,
she sought greater power and turned to the one and only man who can explain. We tried to interview her… “Do you know how these cars work? How are they able to talk.
Apparently they gained this ability, is it like evolving in video games?” “Brain Jones… Brain Jones… Waves…” “Uh… you hear me?” “That tie dye shirt, that look,
his mane…” “So… do you have any coherent comments on these cars?” “Brian, Brian, Brian Jones…”</p>

<p>What does it mean to be a disciple of Brian Jones? What power do you gain? What do you lose (it seems like that would be one’s sanity). This Brian Jones character
has foiled one, now two articles now, he seems to be a force stopping us from reaching the truth. These texting cars will have to be put on hold, for now we must
gather all Hecrenews Journalists, and begin an investigation on Brian Jones.</p>

    <title>Monkeys Preparing to Engage in Battles with Man</title>

    <description>An article about Monkeys Preparing to Engage in Battles with Man</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Return to monke. This is the phrase swarming the internet (ah, not really anymore, you know how that meme economy is constantly changing). Abandon humanity, and
return to monke. Who needs phones, jobs, farms, cities, paved roads, comfy beds, restaruants, and more when you can just abandon it all and return to monke!
Science fairs had to put a new regulation specifically for this, all kids participating were experimenting how they could revert back to a monkey, and the
Science fair just needed some more variety (although Sheeple Dunnel’s insight on this would be greatly appreciated, seems he switched phone numbers and I wasn’t
in the loop). What’s wrong with monkeys? says non South/South Asian people, in a recent interview conducted by local citizen scientists. Only those people know
the true horror of monkeys, and how dangerous they can be. They may be little, but they can attack you, steal your food, break into your house, and do this all
without facing legal consequences! That is obviously unfair, maybe there are truly merits to returning to monke. That’s besides the point, what we are here to
do today is cover the latest and most important ground-breaking news, monumental events that would make each article important for the history books. And recently,
such an event has taken place.</p>

<p>Monkeys have begun their offense on man, just look at the evidence! (Photo courtesy of (or stolen from) telegraph.co.uk)
<img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/monkey_about_to_beat_up_mans.jpeg" alt="Rops you can't see the image" /></p>

<p>Monkeys played the fool for this man, distracting him while a member takes advantage of the man’s blind spot, and prepares to beat him down with a stick. This event
should shed light on how monkeys truly behave. These cunning creatures abuse their intelligence to come up with high IQ plays like these. Aradhana Stefan is an
avid anti-monkeyist, who is a (mon)key player (hahaha see what I did there? I’m so funny) in crumbling and taking down the monkey opposition. 1000s of undergound
monkey gangs were put under arrest in Stefan’s tenure, and she plans to keep on going until there is peace. We were able to talk with her shortly, but only shortly
as she is a busy person fighting for our society.</p>

<p>“Some must venture into the darkness, no longer in the protection of their light, but fight in the darkness to ensure the peace which the light provides. Our
job as anti-monkeyists is to stop monkey opposition. We humans are already so divided against ourselves, just concerened about places of birth, who are parents
are, how much melanin we have, monkeys are using this golden opportunity of man’s struggle with himself to take down man and become the dominant specicies. I
remember reading an article about someone stopping trees from becoming the dominant specicies, and we hold similar beliefs. We try to be as kind as we can to the
monkeys, if we play too rough radical animal activist groups will come and try to take us down. We are fighting hard and nonstop to create a future for humans,
only when we are united together will monkeys be no more of a threat, but as it stands now we are simply just not ready for that yet.”</p>

<p>Stefan’s words are very insightful, and just remind us of how many people are working behind the scenes so we can live comfortably. It is truly altruistic, and
is the birthplace of many legends. I myself went into a zone with a mild amount of monkeys, and it wasn’t pretty. I am currently skedaddling outta here before
these monkeys grab a hold of me (and dang are they fast!) This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Hecrenews Hacker Caught</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/01/22/hecrenews-hacker-caught.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2021/01/22/hecrenews-hacker-caught.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Hecrenews Hacker Caught</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>World’s best news source, the Hecrenews, was hacked by a rogue group of hackers. It started when the
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/12/28/redacted.html">latest article</a> was completed removed, all the text, title, about everything. I can’t bother
to remember what it was about so it’s gone. Worst yet, not only did they delete that article, but they prevented Hecrenews from being able to post any new articles,
and this lasted for almost a month! The world almost plunged into chaos without the constant stream of reliable news, instead turning to unreliable, fake, bad,
terrible, radical, wrong, etc. news sites! Luckily our top tech computer whisperers here at Hecrenews not only got out access back, but with the help of PS
(The famous Phone Search and Rescue Squad, which using the Hecrenews search feature I’m sure you can find some articles about)</p>

<p>The Hecrenews Computer Magicians (HECMAN) (They might be called something else, idk) had hurried in the development of the Hecrenews, and there was one major bug,
one entrypoint, left unoticed, and the hackers exploited the entry point to break in. They used SSH, IPv6, SHA-256, and whatever other fancy data terms you can
imagine. A trojan horse was deployed, which was meant to delete all content from the Hecrenews, but it was poorly coded and only blocked us from posting articles.
After discussing the topics with Wopps Minor, I had surmised the suspect to be one of the hacker from one of Hector’s
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/05/email-hackers-bring-man-closer-to-everyone-in-his-contact-list.html">articles</a>. The act of selling
anti-snaxe spray instead of snaxe spray is a horror itself, but this hacker cracked Isiah Dobrilla’s account, and no small fry could simply do that to the one
who is in kahoots with a Nigerian prince. I was certain it was this group, but it was all speculation, I could not come to a conclusive answer until I got facts.</p>

<p>PS are the expert finders, and they do much more than just phones. Since they haven’t dabbled into too much of technology, HECMAN was apt and eager to assist PS in
searching for the culprits. In a grueling week of coding camp, PS had the fancy tech knowledge to do just about anything HECMAN could. The technology of HECMAN
combined with the searching prowess of PS can only lead to one result: the hackers get caught.</p>

<p>Just three days after the coding teaching camp session, PS and HECMAN found the culprits. I wasn’t paying attention when they were talking about subway net gate
masks and hyper text transfer protocol, so I don’t have much content here for you loyal readers, but I do know that they got the job done. The pertaining officials
and even the HBA were notified about this organization. We’re sure these hackers will face the legal consequences, and luckily we won’t have to deal with them!</p>

<p>Writing another article after a while feels whack, this has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Man Attains Local Fame for Never Slipping Up</title>

    <description>An article about Man Attains Local Fame for Never Slipping Up</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All throughout his childhood Slips McGee was bullied for his name. Everyone would say he would slip up, or fall down. Some even went to the extent of trying to make
Slips McGee trip while walking down the hallways. However, Slips McGee shows resolve and resilience because he has achieved something people thought would never be
possible. Slips McGee never slips up.</p>

<p>While the kids in the back were pretending to be looking for the homework they never completed, Slips McGee had finished his homework days before and already turned
it in, sometimes he finished the homework before the teacher even made it. During P.E., Slips McGee never slipped up. Basketball, baseball, football, American football,
soccer, water polo, you name it, Slips McGee never slips. Slip McGee’s fame from slipping allowed him to make many industry level contacts at a very young age. By the
time he was in middle school advertisers would hire Slip McGee to endorse non-stick pans, Slip McGee was even hired by a company inventing a new type of water that
is super viscous and doesn’t slip and spill all over the place. Slip McGee was already making a name for himself while his classmates were having their world shattered
by learning math had letters.</p>

<p>Slip McGee had attained local fame. If you went to his city, it was known as Slip’s City. Slip McGee had so much enthusiam from his supporters he made an original
blockbuster song, called “Never Gonna Slip Myself.” Slip McGee seems like he would reach celebrity status, but there were a number of factors preventing this. Mainly,
the town from next over had a local celebrity of their own. Dry Bai was known for always staying dry. He would walk in the rain, and not get wet. He would take a bath,
and come out without a drop of water. It was impossible to get Dry Bai wet! The two cities knew what they had to do, the district was not big enough for both of these
forces of natures, so they had a competition. Unfortunately, the competition was determined to be rigged, but by the time authorities found out, Slip McGee was already
banished and Dry Bai had become a celebrity, it was not good news for Slip McGee.</p>

<p>Slip McGee still has his fans, however. If you take a snail, a penny, a nail, and some other various items, the local officer will accept the bribe and allow you to
visit Slip McGee, and Slip McGee still connects with his fans through that medium. Every day Slip McGee is showing off his anti-slip abilities, being unable to slip.
Rainy days, muddy water, super slip surfaces, water slides, Slip McGee simply does not slip. Slip McGee soon caught word of the competition being rigged, and plans to
make a comeback.</p>

<p>For now we can just be in awe of Slip McGee’s ability to never slip, it is a world wonder. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <description>An article about Boss of Esteemed News Company Lowers Pay Rates to Unbearable Amounts</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So there has been a lack of articles once again. It seems we are running into one of
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/01/hecrenews-experiences-dearth-of-dirt.html">these</a> problems once again. My legendary streak has been broken, and
my heart along with it. Not to worry, it is an emotional problem, not a physical one. The loss of my streak has been all the rave in these recent times, and there have
been a few major questions on everyone’s mind. First, “why did this happen?” and two, “when will Mister Mjir post another article?” Well to answer the latter question,
that is today itself! Yes, I have returned once more. To answer the former question, I must first tell you loyal Hecrenews readers a true story.</p>

<p>There is this esteemed news source, an award winning news source, a trustable news source, the best news source in the world. Many of these claims were self proclaimed,
but it was in factm a news source. The workers were pushed to extreme conditions, with the boss always wanting content, always wanting something to post. One poor
author had to write constant articles daily to save himself and his friends from a terrible plight, inducing the wrath of the boss. The boss’s pay was low, but it
wasn’t low enough to catch the attention of government authorities, it was passable. In the same way many of the articles were passable, the boss didn’t even read the
headline, just saw the article and sent it over to be posted. There was hope for the hard-working, aspirational writers, as the boss said one day, “If you keep a streak,
your pay will be increased.” The boss said  that for a streak, but raised the regular pay as well. Perhaps a wave of good feelings was passing by, but it was only
passing by. Soon, after a couple of months, the boss revoked these words. The pay from the streak was lifted, and the pay was reduced to the barely passable, and in
protest, articles were halted for a short amount of time.</p>

<p>This well esteemed news source, award winning of self-proclaimed awards, trustable news source, best news source in the world is none other than the Hecrenews. Yes, it
pains me to say this but our news source has blundered. The HBA immediately began the process of replacing the boss with someone more capable. It turns out the boss
was once a good person, but was then corrupted by the snaxii (as a spokesperson from the HBA told me). How the snaxii do such things, we knew they can persuade
youngins like <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/27/billa-the-rise-and-fall-of-an-undergound-school-organization.html">Billa</a> but then imposing their
control on the boss was unforseen, it is truly a tragedy. We must come together as a community, as a nation, as a planet, as multiple universes. We need to see
past the differences between us humans, the Snaxii only benefit from our interal conflicts. If we can band together across nations, across planets, across the
Hecresphere, hope to defeating the Snaxii exists.</p>

<p>Believing in the Hecretary Bird and being a devotee is one thing, a really good thing, but true action starts at the individual level. We need to step it up to stop
the Snaxii.</p>

<p>That was pretty inspirational, but this wraps up this status update of the Hecrenews, I’m sure the length is long enough to be HAC approved. This has been Mister Mjir,
popping in and popping out.</p>

    <title>Airplanes have Strange Ability to Fly</title>

    <description>An article about Airplanes have Strange Ability to Fly</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solveiga Ulisses was looking to expand her local business overseas, but needed a fast method of getting past the vast ocean to reach the exotic city where Mount
Sundoro lies. Simply walking a swimming would take too long, and while it would be a nice exercise, she simply had better things to do (like running her local
business which deals in local affairs). Since she is not [insert generic rich inventor superhero] cars apparently do not work underwater. Boats are fine but they
simply take too long, and there are many distractions. Using an animal might be a viable option, but the choatic animal lovers group (who have broken into numerous
people’s residencies and put down pets) will get onto her, and there will be little help there. Ulisses had to come up with some new innovative idea ot cross overseas,
and boy oh boy is the story interesting.</p>

<p>Ulisses took a trip to a hangar. A hangar is a place where large metallic vehicles are stored. These strange contraptions are called airplanes, and no one really
knows why. SAR (Hecrenew’s science team, stands for something I’m sure) is on break so I cannot get expert information on what an airplane is. Airplanes are quite
clunkly machines, they are very big and very slow on the ground, in fact they are usually towed around by other vehicles. What a shame. However, after the pilot of
the machine started discussing what the machine does, Ulisses was in awe. Airplanes have a peculiar ability to take flight. This has never been seen before. The animals
who ruled the land got demoted when humans began building houses and cars, the animals who ruled the seas got demoted when humans began building ships, and now the
uncontested ruler of the skies, birds, are about to get demoted.</p>

<p>“How can such a machine fly?” asked Ulisses in utter shock. It was radical, madness, unfathomable. “Well you see, it came at a great cost, this machine right here. Of
course most machines are bound to the ground in some way, you can pretend water is some sort of ground that the boat rolls on. But skies, that’s just impossible. I
did want to fly but I knew it was impossible. This was all until I went into a very suspicious looking alley and met the man who would change my fate, but at what a
cost, I can’t even describe it. What was his name. Ah yes, Brian Jones. I have said it once and I shall not say it again. He is a man of pure evil, destruction,
insanity. If I keep on talking I will become delusional, let’s end this there.” Ignoring the very sus person the pilot was discussing, at the end of the day
airplanes do have the strange ability to fly. No one really know how it works. After Issac Newton invented gravity after the apple fell on his head, nothing was
able to fly, and yet planes do. It must be some dark magic force.</p>

<p>The boss doesn’t pay me enough to do a comprehensive investigation and proper journalism on this matter so I will just leave it at that, planes are sus and can fly.
Ulisses utilized this ability to travel overseas to Mount Sundoro and opened up a foreign branch of her local company. As Ulisses herself says, “business is booming,”
and the company is doing pretty well with its overseas branch. Ulisses has to be careful not to expand too much, or else her business won’t be local anymore, but
the progress and profits are rolling in.</p>

<p>The strange ability of planes to fly is very intriuging though, I will pass this on to Wopps Minor, who has written many great articles about the science of our
world and experiements. For now this has been Mister Mjir, popping in and popping out.</p>

    <title>Kid Finishes All Homework, Very Bored</title>

    <description>An article about Kid Finishes All Homework, Very Bored</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nadya Ségolène was an avid learner even in her youngest years. She learned how to read a book before her parents could even teach her what an apple was. She was doing
adition before she could walk. She was conducting experiments before she could talk! Her parents were worried because they knew Ségolène’s superior genius would come
at a cost, so they did their absolute best to ensure their child’s emotional and social growth, but it seems she was good at that too. Experts say she read the
Hecrenews to obtain even more information (as a supplement to her daily encyclopedias, dictionaries, textbooks, literature, which she never forget once she read).
After reading about some school named Leafblower Elementary, she knew what needed to be done to be successful at everything. Ségolène was the one who was known by her
teachers because she was able to unite the entire class, not only become friends with everyone, but be a mediator and solve everyone’s problems. Her parents didn’t
even know what to do with her, she was just too bright, in fact, they were getting advice from Ségolène herself.</p>

<p>What really sets Ségolène apart from the other child prodigies is something much different from the others. Others skip grades, attend college early, are just super
smart. Ségolène had finished every school’s college cirriculum (after going through all the high school cirriculum’s) by the time she entered pre-school. She had
already read all the academic papers and was reading on the breakthroughs in science and technology. No one knew what to do with her, she was literally to smart. Who
just casually walks into Pre-K, of all grades, and has already finished every single course, subject, at (in theory) every single school. Ségolène just now had to be
good at sports, but no one doubted she wouldn’t show results. It would only be a matter of time before the professors and scientists began seeking her knowledge, but
there was one problem.</p>

<p>Ségolène wanted to grow up as a normal kid. She wanted to interact with people her own age, not some creepy old people who would just use her to get opinions/questions
answered. However, school was very boring as she already knew everything. Most of the school day was “learning new material,” but Ségolène was only at school for the
social interactions. She couldn’t be disruptive to the class, and a few days she even taught the class and studies showed those kids IQ’s doubled every time Ségolène
taught them. Ségolène considered creating a website that talked about many academic courses so people across the world could learn but that was already done by some
Sal Khan guy (in the universe that had Earth at least). Ségolène considered expanding this to other galaxies, and perhaps other universes but going to a different
universe would be very dangerous, you would need a team of people all at Ségolène’s level to be successful. Ségolène considered solving many societal problems, and
had already began working on them. Clean water, global hunger, access to the internet, a better education system, all the plans were in the works and now the only
step left was for some old people in government to give the O.K. to do it.</p>

<p>Other kids seem to have a general consensus on how they view their classmate. “We wanna be like her, and she’s a huge inspiration. I wish I could be that smart. No, I
don’t wish, everyday I’m working twice as hard as the day before so I can catch up,” says  Terri Christabelle. The kids see Ségolène as an inspiration and aspire.
Perhaps the students around her will also be problem solvers just because she is, perhaps not, who knows?! I think this article is about the length to be HAC
approved so I’m not going to write much more. We’ll keep up updated on when Ségolène finds something that isn’t boring. In the meanwhile, see if you can
finish all the school’s by Pre-K, pretty tricky, huh. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <description>An article about The Mysterious Disapperance of the Pink T-Rex</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zoos may seem all casual and whatnot but all the industry zoo’ers know it’s a fierce and competitive battlefield. A few months back a local zoo made it’s spotlight
in the news (and the Hecrenews no less, the world’s (and worlds beyond!!!) most reliable newsource, covering everying in the Hecresphere) by adding
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/21/local-zoo-adds-homo-sapiens-to-exhibit.html">homo sapiens</a> to ‘take care of’ but insiders say it’s just
to draw more customers in. However, disaster struck a one local zoo who claims to have just the thing needed to make them stand out from the rest.</p>

<p>Local zookeeper, Vladislav Mauricette, who works at the local zoo (but not the one Deep Shunsuke manages) was in charge of making sure the new exhibit was ready.
Many on lookers saw huge curtains in the reptilian area of the zoo and their curiosity peaked, a few mischevious devils tried getting into the exhibit but were
“polietly” kicked out. Passerby James “Big Killah” is here to tell us all about it (in his own opinion of course). “I be walking down the zoo, then I come here
and see something new! There’s something sus going on here with all the big curtains, I’m counting the people here and it’s more than 10! I’m the hippest rapper
on the street, the coolest guy you can meet. But I tell you, I tell you man, this new exhibit’s grabbing everyone’s attention like a box of raisan bran!” We
discontinued the interview as he starting rhyming off-topic. So this new exhibit was no small addition, it was definetely something huge, but what was it?
Read the title or the next paragarph to find out, we are going to ask the man himself, Mauricette.</p>

<p>“Luckily the boss isn’t too mad, the culprit is someone big, someone with big plans, and they are making the ting go quack from way back,” says Mauricette. “So
what exactly was it behind those curtains?” I asked. “You won’t believe it, even I didn’t believe, it was great, it was legendary, it was exquisite. We got our
hands on a T-Rex. Those are rare enough, and we had a pink T-Rex. Do you know how rare that is?!” “Um…I didn’t do my research this time and had no clue this
existed, so I’ll go with no.” “Well, just try and picture it. I’m pretty sure you can picture a T-Rex, now just make it pink instead of green.” “Wait they were
green, I was certain they were #34f9e2!” “What the…anyways, we lost it. I don’t know what happened. Obviously it didn’t escape, the traces left weren’t like
that and we wouldn’t have let it escape.”</p>

<p>Afterwards, the local zoo contacted the best in the business, the Phone Search and Rescue Squad (PS). If you do not know who they are I suggest you catch up on
that saga <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/10/phone-on-silent-lost-searchers-cannot-find.html">here</a>. The PS immediately deployed their forces,
they thought a T-Rex would be easy to find, it’s quite hard to find, but the culprit they are dealing with is quite experienced, and PS isn’t going easy on them.
The PS has a minor lead, but it is not a very strong one, we do not doubt the PS will be able to track down the T-Rex, but retrieving it will be something they
have never done before.</p>

<p>Mauricette is worried about the zoo’s reputation. If the Pink T-Rex isn’t procured within a week, the zoo will lose street cred., and they may have to go out of
business, possibly one of the worst things for a zoo. Of course this article isn’t long enough so we need to think of clever reasons to pad the length so it’s
HAC approved (Hecrenews Article Quality Control). The remaining question to ask, why were they keeping it there?</p>

<p>“Of course most people think it’s to show off, especially people who claim to be in the business. While yes, we are going to be showing off our Pink T-rex, that
is not the main reason we are taking it in. We take pride in providing aid to animals. If you look at our exhibits, you’ll notice that we only have endangered
species. Here we can increase the species’ population numbers and start releasing them back into the wild, their real homes (the ones which aren’t filled with
man-made structures, of course). While our industrial growth may have been good for technology, it has really been bad for the environment and these animals.
Look at these poor animals, they never learned to throw stuff and we humans never got nerfed and broke the evolution system. Of course, we aren’t doing much to
help. If I want the readers to do something about this, it would be take action against deforestation and begin forestation be dehousetation. We can destroy
homes, get some cement, steel, other useful resources, and build more compact apartments or homes. Instead of building homes on the environment, we should have
the environment be our home and have smaller shelters. But of course this is a radical idea and I don’t want another calamity going on, but it’s just an idea
to think about.” “That is quite radical, luckilly our boss doesn’t care as long as we pump out articles.”</p>

<p>I sure do hope they find that Pink T-Rex, looking forward to seeing it live. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Vegetarian Wolfs Down an Entire Forest</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/10/28/vegetarian-wolfs-down-an-entire-forest.html</link>

    <description>An article about Vegetarian Wolfs Down an Entire Forest</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The phrase “wolf down a meal” is synonymous with non-vegetarians. You go to fast food joint and see people wolf down a double McWhopper Egg Salad Beef-Chicken Egg
Deluxe Premium along with frieds, chicken nuggets (preferably dinosaur shaped). The hungry guy at the fancy resturant “wolfs down” that big, juicy, steak (of
course at the disdain of vegetarians). However, one local vegetarians, who is rumored to be from Florida, Luka Miloš, is about to forever change the way of the word,
and maybe a whole ecosystem while he’s at it.</p>

<p>At first the local wildlife and park safety crew didn’t notice anything when a few trees went ‘missing,’ as the locals reported. “Happens all the time,” said the man
on guard at the time, who happened to be the cheif of the safety crew, Ghenadie Onyekachi. However, as the days went on, more and more trees went missing. Onyekachi
decided an investigation was needed, but it was not a complex nor a long investigation. Onyekachi witnessed a queer man casually uproot a tree and eat it. “It was
a pure spectacle, a miracle even, don’t know how it’s good but it’s unbelievable!” Unfortunately for Onyekachi, Miloš had just devoured the last tree in the entire
national park. There were no trees left. One could only hope Miloš did not eat the seeds, but no matter what, a long time will be required to reverse these changes.</p>

<p>Now the question everyone is asking Miloš, “Why/How is he eating trees?” We just had to ask Miloš in person. “Please don’t eat me,” I said. “Oh no worries, I’m a
vegetarian, and you don’t look like a non-vegetarian so I doubt I will be eating you.” “It worries me that you doubt instead of thinking it’s ludicrous, I’ll have
you know the Hecrenews is the number 1 news sources and is run by the HBA. Anywho, how and why are you eating these trees?” “Well you see, I’m a vegetarian like I said.
It’s not that I don’t like people killing animals for consumption, it’s just that I want to kill plants for consumption. I want to eat as many plants as possible, and
this is to ensure they won’t become the dominant species on our planet. Someone’s gotta do the job.” “Well that is very interesting. I feel like I’ve written some
similar articles on similar topics but I’m too lazy to link them in this article so why don’t you elaborate on that? Like anything you want the audience to know? I
wanna try to get a picture of what’s going on in your head.” “So I guess I’ll have to begin where it all started. You know, I used to be a non-vegetarian, eating meat
and all. Hey, if someone isn’t controlling the chicken, cow, and pig populations then soon there will be more of them than we can handle, and that’s gonna be problems.
I used to be non-vegetarian because I cared about the environment and plant life. I wouldn’t hurt a flower, what did a flower ever do wrong to me. But I will never
forgot the day it all changed. See me and my homies were doing an unsupervised cleanup near a watery area with lots of vegetation, and then, while going down near the
water where the trash was, one of my homies got pricked by some thorns. Man, that hurt, and I wasn’t even pricked by them! After that he slipped into some poison ivy,
and got scratched by some branches. It was then my views about plants and the environment changed, well not really the environment more really plants. Plants can
cause this much damage, if they are not regulated, then problems like these can escalate. Someone needs to stop them and I realized how evil these plants were, so I
became vegetarian, and began a crusade to eat as many plants as I could. As you can see here, I just ate this entire forest. Hello, oh no, he’s sleeping.” “Frogs!!!
Oh, just a nightmare. Don’t worry I’m recording this so I don’t have to pay attention now. I’m not gonna question the biology of possibility of how you ate the
tree, I’m kinda used to stuff like that at this point. So, are you going to stop anytime soon?” “Nope.”</p>

<p>Miloš was banned from the park by Onyekachi and Onyekachi is now being a more diligent guard and created a secret corps to be on the lookout for vegetarians looking
to eat all of the plants in the national park. Onyekachi is embarassed, but promises to do better. The boss can’t fire him because no one’s really interested in
being a park safety person these days (so sad). I think this article length will be HAC approved, so I’ll end it here. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now
popping out.</p>

    <title>Painted Horses Knock on Doors</title>

    <description>An article about Painted Horses Knock on Doors</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local resident Jordi Emilia was not expecting any visitors when we woke up at 2:29 AM in the morning, but yet he had. There was already no expectation for visitors,
and there was an even lower expectation it would be a horse, the percentage of it being a painted horse too was impossible, virtually 0! I am sensing a negative
expectation, I’ll just wait here for Sheeple, the head of Hecrenews Science and Research (SAR) to confirm me on this. In the meanwhile, Emilia was not the only one
to experience this phenomenom. All across the local town painted horses were knocking on people’s doors.</p>

<p>The police arrived at about 7:00 AM, they couldn’t function until they got their dosage of coffee and donuts. However, the cops could not disperse the painted horses,
they just brushed off the cops and relentlessly knocked on the doors. It was quite surprising how the doors didn’t fall down, those things sure are quite sturdy.
Anywho, skeptics and critics (all wrong I’ll have you know) have speculated the ‘so-called ‘painted horses’’ are actually zebras, but this is not possible because
zebras are from the savannah, and the local town is in a one foresty kinda area, which is not a savannah, meaning no zerbra. Others have claimed these zebras are
invasive species, with a queer tendency to knock on people’s doors. However, this is just nonsense. Who are the zebras invading, how does a zebra smuggle itself
across the ocean? It doesn’t, easy as that.</p>

<p>The proof of these horse’s intellegence has been seen in the past. When student Evie Neizan rode her bus everyday to school, she passed by a ranch. However,
she noticed the horses were always up to something. They were all gathered together and clustered far away from the perimeter, making the ranch seem like a cow-only
ranch (possibly there were some bulls but Neizan isn’t sure). Everyone thought Neizan was crazy, and this already negatively affected her social health because she
was a ‘quiet-kid’ at school, also now labeled a weirdo. Oh no, talking about school again just brings painful emotions, oh Bulstrode, where are you now? The Leafblower
saga is over but now we need to do journalism on bullying in local schools?! Aw man, not like I have any other leads. Anywho, Neizan easily predicted the horses
hijacking a school bus and crashing into the school and entering the building. The horses were mad sus but the school’s administration was able to hold them down.</p>

<p>Some loyal Hecrenews readers had their sus alarms activated, such as Hektor Klim. Klim had been reading the letter of the day articles, and noticed a pattern. If he
combined the letter of the day articles, it read a cryptic message, despite Mister Mjir claiming himself there was
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/10/12/mister-mjir-returns.html">no meaning behind them</a> and they were truly randomly generated. Now Mister Mjir is safe
for now, because it is not zebras knocking on the doors, but in fact horses, who are painted as zebras.</p>

<p>At about 11:20 AM the fire department came with their fancy hoses and all and after spraying some water revealed that in fact, the creatures constantly knocking on the
door were horses, as the black and white coloring faded away. With the horses’ cover blown they hopped and gallopped away from the scene, knowing that there was no
way the police would be able to identify them. The police are still trying to figure out who these rowdy group of horses are, their end goal, and how they got painted.
The chief deputy doubts it’s the horses and believes there’s a human behind this but we at the Hecrenews know the truth, and it is most likely probably 50-50 chance
possibly (perhaps) that maybe it’s actually the horses. We don’t know how they painted themselves either but we might be sure they did it.</p>

<p>This was quite a strange event, but with the power of the community and the friendly first responders, they got the problem solved. What a nice article. This has
been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>High Schooler Escapes Strife by Biking</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/10/17/high-schooler-escapes-strife-by-biking.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/10/17/high-schooler-escapes-strife-by-biking.html</guid>
    <description>An article about High Schooler Escapes Strife by Biking</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The life of a high school student is quite wild. Hours upon hours of studying, extracirriculars, side-projects, gaming, chatting, socializing, trying to have life
admist academics, all to get good GPAs SAT/ACT scores to get into the dream college. We here at the Hecrenews noticed a particular talent, one leader amongst the
followers, one flower amongst the grass, Zoticus Harald, has figured out a way to escape the high school grind, and he was the only one we could interview because
everyone else was too busy doing homework…</p>

<p>“The school grind is scary,” said Harald, “I figured out a way to escape it but it grind keeps on pulling you back in. It’s kinda like a gambling addiction, I mean,
of course I wouldn’t know what that’s like, I have not ever, definetely have not ever, gambled, not illegally either.” “Ummm… that’s sus, but continue,” I said.
“Anyways, I figured out the way to temporarily escape it, and I am hoping these smart kids can use my temporary solution as a stepping stone to escape this
terrible way of life, it’s all in a hope of a better future,” said Harald. Harald is one of the kids who is heavily on the grind. He is taking all AP, or college
level courses, is doing baseball, and is involved in one of his school’s CTSOs. A CTSO is a club you get to join by being a part of a CTE class, but there are so
many acronyms I have no storage left for any more so I didn’t ask what it was. Initially in Harald’s high school career he spent 26 hours a day doing homework and
other school-related work, there was no time for relaxation, and no time for sleep.</p>

<p>“So I’ll tell you how I discovered this method of escapism. One day I got an email from this random stranger, I think he had the wrong email address which is quite
concerning since mine is [REDACTED]. Anywho, this mans ended his message with the word “Oohbeedoo.” Now my favourite news source, the Hecrenews of course, has covered
a man named Oohbeedoo, but this context does not beg a proper noun, but rather, something else. My dictionary had no answers so I went to the internet to search for
a solution. I then came upon a movie called “The Jungle Book” by Walt Disney based off a book made by Rudyard Kipling. It was a queer movie, but there was one thing
which stuck with me in particular. There is this one character in the movie who is called Baloo, and he sings one of the songs in the movie, called the
“Bear Necessities.” One lyric he mentions is forget about your worries and your strife. It was then I began the first step of escaping the terrible High School life:
realization. I realized that the life I lived was not the one I truly aspired, and after you realize, then you can begin working towards change.”</p>

<p>“Some people call this a natural high,” said Harald. “I just think of it as a hobby really. I started biking, because I needed to work on my physical strength, and
something magical happened. While I was biking, I forgot about all my worries and my strife. I was just enjoying moving the pedals, feeling that fresh air, and the
thrill of the speed. I had found my version of the bear necessities Baloo was speaking of. This was great, I fit biking into my schedule, and it always allowed
me to recharge my mind and body, it was life-changing. However, this is not going to be a permanent solution to escape the clutches of school life, because as soon
as I am done biking, all the sensation of the grind returns, and my mind is consumed once more. I really do hope if people are able to find a way to temporarily
escape the grind, someone can come up with a permanent way to break free from these chains.”</p>

<p>Harald has started an underground school organization to try and free kids from the curse, and he has already helped about 20 people find temporary solutions.
Perhaps one day Harald will be able to escape, but for now, this has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Leafblower: Standoff</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/10/16/leafblower-standoff.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/10/16/leafblower-standoff.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Leafblower: Standoff</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right where we left off <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/10/15/leafblower-tensions-climax.html">last time</a>, oh wait,
technically time hasn’t passed since last time. I guess it’s not really last time? Huh, time is really weird. Anywho, I am standing
at the Leafblower’s district’s board’s meeting room, where time has currently frozen due to the superintendent, who is also known as
Daredevil Jack. Somehow I am not affected by the time travel effects and I’m just chilling.</p>

<p>Daredevil Jack and the fighting spirit behind him began approaching me. “After I take you out, there is going to be no one left to stop
me.” He was quite intimidating perhaps on a level to compete with Af Roman, but I somehow was not paralyzed by his demeanor. Suddenly
a spark of electricity appeared before me and out popped an apparatus, but this was no ordinary apparatus, this was Adalbert Bulstrode’s
time machine! “Ah, so you’re also not affected by the time freeze,” I said. “Nope,” said Adalbert as he walked out. “I could explain it
but I would probably fry your brain because it’s some really complicated sciency stuff, don’t worry about it. Now, to deal with <em>you</em>
said Bulstrode as he looked at Daredevil Jack.” Apparently this was their first time meeting, and Bulstrode still knew where he was
and that he was the man behind this. “Look at what’s become of you. I heard from Mugabe you used to be a popular kid. But then the system
chained you up or hauled you away and you were never seen again (or you just graduated) and now you are a puppet of the system. No,
the system is gone because that girl overthrew it, you are a lingering fragment of the past.” “But you cannot stop me,” said Jack. “That
I can, I’ve just stopped by to give my regards to Mjir.” “What, what are you going to do?” “If fate allows it we will meet again.” “Huh?”
Bulstrode then tackled Jack and took him into the time machine. After a few seconds the machine disappeared and time began its usual flow.
“I’m kinda nervous for this interview,” said one of the students and I remembered what was happening. “Sorry, something came up, I gotta
go,” I told the crew.</p>

<p>I rushed back to the Hecrenews HQ. “Bulstrode is gone.” I told everyone. Everyone just stood there in shock. “Bulstrode was the true, true
friend, and also a genius. This can’t be true.” “Well it’s a long story, but to save the world he had to sacrifice himself.” We left
work and somberly contniued the rest of our day. We later held a memorial service for our fallen hero.</p>

<p>A while later, the main SAR man himself, Sheeple Dunnel, appraoched me with a device that looked like a high schooler’s engineering
project. “Bulstrode is not gone,” said Dunnel. He dialed some knobs and we heard a queer sound. After turning some more dials and knobs,
Bulstrode’s voice can be heard. “Hello, this is Bulstrode. If you are getting this message, I have figured out a way for us to communicate,”
“And this is the device?” “Yes, but Bulstrode is still sending us how to create the audio input thingy so we can talk to him. Bulstrode
is not gone, we may be able to get him back.”</p>

<p>Hope in humanity and mankind has restored. As for Leafblower Elementary, well, it’s surely going to change. But there is no doubt it is
still going be the school everyone’s talking about. I’m not sure if we’ll be getting any more big things from Leafblower anytime soon.”
For now, this has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Leafblower Tensions Climax</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/10/15/leafblower-tensions-climax.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/10/15/leafblower-tensions-climax.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Leafblower Tensions Climax</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here at the Hecrenews we answer the big questions, and the biggest question on everyone’s minds is “what is going on at Leafblower Elementary.” It is truly
so revolutionary it will change history, no, it will go down in the books. In fact, some modern historians are already writing this stuff down (using exclusively
Hecrenews articles, from the most reliable news source in the Hecresphere may I remind you). It has been a month since Džana has been up to her antics, and with all
the time traveling stuff being over for now it was time to go and finally return the the school to see what was up.</p>

<p><a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/09/02/leafblower-board-taken-down.html">Where we last left off</a> Džana and her cronies, or comrades, depending on
which side you are on, took control of the school board. The superintendent has mostly been quiet which was quite strange and Džana’s access to the school board gave
her immense access over the school district. Not only could she ensure greatness, prosperity, and happiness for Leafblower students, but other local elementary,
middle, and high schools as well, although the local high schools are monsters of their own, Džana would surely not mess with them. Džana passed many new acts aftering
becoming the head of the board to protect children’s happiness and innocent youthful lives. One act was a “Grades are Bad” (GAB) act which prohibited the use of
percentage based grades, and required teachers to teach kids concepts. Another act was a “Who cares that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, how do I get
a job and pay taxes act,” which (other than being very long named, too long to bother creating an acronym for) ensures kids will develop real life skills. High School
is all about the GPA, grades, learning academics, so Džana believed elementary and middle school should teach students real world skills so they will be successful
outside of high school. While there is an endless list of acts Džana has passed, one more to broach is the “Big Passion Project” act (aptly abbreviated to Big PP)
allows students to find passions and create projects to help their communities. Džana was particularily inspired by
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/08/gamer-games-to-heat-up-homes-during-winter.html">this article</a> to pass the Big PP act. Even kids can change the
world, and she already knows very few high school students do this as they are focused on grades so Džana wants to give the opportunity to these younger kids. After
passing these acts many are in agreement Džana should become the president of the country, they will bribe for an age restriction change and may be successful.</p>

<p>I was walking into the board building to interview Džana the madlad (or madlady, madlad rolls of the tongue better) in person but I felt an ominous presence there.
Obviously I ignored it, could just be a side effect of time travel after all, Bulstrode is still working on listing out all the symptoms to become FDA approved or
however that process works, I’m not a scientist so ask someone at SAR (Hecrenews Science and Research). There were a bunch of kids wearing casual clothes but I could
already tell all of these were geniuses who will actually change the world. Džana has made a new system for greatness, so greatness will follow. We began setting up
the interview, and it was even going to be broadcasted to the local T.V. station, pretty exciting but also kinda nerve-inducing.</p>

<p>After about 10 min. of meet and greet the interview began. As we were conducting the opening statements the room doors got busted down and a silhouette stood there
with fog effects included. After the smoke cleared we realized who it was, it was the superintendent himself, Jack the Daredevil. “Enough of this nonsense, you think
I’m gonna let some kids take over the school?” A ghostly spirit appeared behind Jack as he shouted “The World!!!,” and I of course had to respond, “Is that a
JoJo’s reference?!” Jack shifted his glance towards me, and it would’ve been intimidating but I am a Hecrenews journalist, this ain’t nothing. “What the hecc?” said
Jack in shock. I looked around and realized no one else was moving, everything was perfectly still. “I stopped time,” said Jack, “How are you able to move?” “Eh
I don’t really understand this time travel and time breaking/bending stuff, idk tbh.” Most likely one of the effects of time traveling included being immune to
people who try and stop time. “Well, here’s the thing,” said Jack, “I can stop time indefinetely, and it looks like I will have to put you down, forcefully if needed.”</p>

<p>It was then I realized the pickle I was in, I was running out of options as my cell phone didn’t work (it was frozen in time) so the only option I had left was to
place all of my hope on the Hecretary Bird. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Mister Mjir Returns</title>

    <description>An article about Mister Mjir Returns</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After spending about a month doing time-travelling shenanigans, Mister Mjir finally returns back to the present. Additionally, history has been rewritten and
the revered daily article streak has returned! (Although it seems some corners were cut to maintain that streak).</p>

<p>Wait a second, this article is about me so I’ll just write it in first person.</p>

<p>So first there are some rumors going on about the letter of the day containing some secret message if you read all of them in order, but this is nonsense. There
is no meaning to the letter of the day, I literally just google a random number generator and then toss that letter of the alphabet into the article and call it a
day. It’s a surefire way to ensure I don’t lose that intimidating streak, so please stop asking about it, the emails are (not) overflowing.</p>

<p>Also many people must be wondering “what time travelling is like” or “what happened to Bulstrode.” First of all, if you are not acquainted with Bulstrode I suggest
you check out the Hecrenews’ search feature to get up to speed. I basically left his super-secret top-secret labratory and returned to my good ol’ pals Wopps Minor,
Banana the Human, the new guy (although not so new these days) Hector, and my not so good ol’ pal the boss, who is wondering where I’ve been but can’t disagree with
the results. So as for what time travelling is like it feels pretty normal. Sometimes weeks and days pass but it only feels like a few seconds in the machine. It
really doesn’t feel anything special, the concept itself is pretty cool but doing it makes it less cool. Now some of you may be wondering about all the paradoxes
and dangers of times travelling, but our avid readers know Bulstrode already addressed this. The website is too lazy to update just because history was rewritten
by time travelers, so the article about me losing my streak will still exist even though the streak was never lost.</p>

<p>I’m excited to get back into the Hecrenews flow, we are the number 1 news source in the Hecresphere after all! In other news that rival news site we were talking
about is in such a state the boss is probably gonna call of the war because it would be pitiful to see them fight back. I don’t even know why we need to wage
war with other news sites but if the boss says you gotta do it you gotta do it, catch my drift?</p>

<p>Also if the Hecrenews isn’t enough HBA content to satisfy you, make sure to check out the Hecrenet! This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out!</p>

    <title>How to Properly Wallop a Simian</title>

    <description>An article about How to Properly Wallop a Simian</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, it has really come to this. We at the hecrenews have had so little dirt since <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/09/03/cheating-club-disbanded-as-schools-closes.html">this article</a> that we’ve resorted to posting the content of others. Huh. Come to think about it, I saw that article for the first time yesterday, and yet it was created and posted almost a month ago. Sus is all I can say.</p>

<p>Anyways, here’s the very alarming guide. At this time, we advise all readers of the Hecrenews that do not wish to be A) utterly disgusted, B) terribly frightened, C) completely insanitized (to be made insane), or D) all of the above to kindly avert their eyes. Did you do that? Good. Oh wait, how are you reading this with your eyes closed? That’s kinda sus. But not as sus as this piece of work:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/guide_to_monkey_beating_blog_post.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>In case you for some reason haven’t had enough of this deeply unsettling article, here’s the text version. Once again, avert your eyes and avert them now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“So, it has come to my attention that this quaint little blog of mine has been receiving mad attention lately. Ever since I exposed that FRAUD Hooshar Manus, viewers have been rolling in. And with those viewers, I’ve consistently gotten one question above all else: “How can I aspire with my ideas and become as fearsome a monkey-beater as you?” First of all, I am the ONLY Monkey-beater. Call yourself what you want, but not Monkey-beater. I’ll beat you if you try and kid me. Secondly, I’d be happy to teach all of you street-rats my techniques, honed over the years.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Above is a depiction of one of the creatures that you will be an expert in beating, by the time you finish reading this post</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>First, you must practice. When you really get good at this thing, the population of monkeys in your area will diminish like mad. So hone your skills with other, less satisfying creatures. I personally recommend endangered species, there’s something about them that just hits the spot, you know?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>After you’ve secured all the necessary materials, you get to the fun part. Beating. Beating the creature senselessly is the fun part. Fun. Fun! Depending on your comfort level, you can try whacks, thwacks, or thumps to get started. If you’re feeling tons of emotional release, you’re doing it right. Once that introductory bit has passed, you can move on to the real stuff. Try out some slaps, some smacks, and some snaccs (Monkey-beating sure does burn calories like mad). If the monkey is screaming in pain annd you’re screaming in evil, demented pleasure, you’re doing something right.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>After you’re done monkey-beating, or gorrila-grinding, or whatever, make sure you have a nice, long cooldown. Professional monkey-beaters such as myself (so professional, it’s in the name) can often get very emotional during monkey beating. All that pent up frustrations just flow outta you, y’know? Personally, I would recommend some gentle (not really) beating, more to cool you off than to inflict further pain (although it will still inflict pain, that’s kind of a given when you’re monkey-beating. )</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The Clinical Benefits of Monkey-beating - Monkey-beating is a great stress-reliever, you should try it out! Whether you’re massacring Macaques or terrorizing Tamarins, or even just plain hurting Howler Monkeys, it’s important to just relax and have tons of fun! Additionally, some therapists have started to look at monkey-beating as a means of rehabilitation after trauma. Something or other about that sweet, sweet cathartic release. Well, I’ve about learned you all all I know about the delicate and precise art of monkey-beating. So now go ahead, pwn those primates, antagonize those apes, do whatever suits your fancy pretty much. Yee-haw!”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Monkey-beater. <em>How to Properly and Efficiently Engage in Monkey-beating: An Expert’s Opinion</em>, Blogger, 30 Sept. 2020.)</p>

<hr />

<p>After that descent into depravity, I’m almost glad to be done with this article. You may have heard how Hector called me out for being a lazy wuss lately. Well, I’m not. It isn’t laziness that restricts me from posting as much as the days of Old, it’s those <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/30/an-update-on-our-legal-troubles.html">procrastination lessons</a> Shroops the Mighty gave me. In hindsight, that was probably a big mistake. But that brings us to the matter at hand. My honor’s been slighted, so in proper fashion I must dish out one of my own in return. Ooh, here’s one!</p>

<p>Hector is a VEGETARIAN!</p>

<p>Wopps out.</p>

    <title>The Resistance: Trying to Take Down Nit Flex</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/09/29/the-resistance-trying-to-take-down-nit-flex.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/09/29/the-resistance-trying-to-take-down-nit-flex.html</guid>
    <description>An article about The Resistance: Trying to Take Down Nit Flex</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may have heard, streaming giant <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/14/local-streaming-service-deletes-cancel-subscription-button.html">Nit Flex’s</a> recent decision to remove its ‘Cancel Subscription’ button has resulted in almost immediate extreme financial success. Nit Flex’s CEO, Nithin Felix, is “absolutely rolling in it” these days, as BananaTheHuman tells me teens are saying nowadays. Whatever Felix is rolling in, I sure do hope it’s sanitary!</p>

<p>But we’re not here to debate the purported health benefits of rolling in this ambiguous “it”. We’re here to talk about something <em>really</em> newsworthy. In a sudden turn of events, all-controlling behemoth Nit Flex has been completely, utterly rekt by a ragtag team of hackers. Kinda reminds you of that movie that’s more popular than Star Wars, doesn’t it? Anyways, let’s not pad the article length any more (I think these two paragraphs are good enough for HAC to “okay” this one) and delve right into it.</p>

<p>It all began with Nit Flex’s decision to remove their subscribers’ option to cancel the subscription. As we’ve already established, this, combined with a massive rate increase, made it so that Nit Flex was “rolling in” that ambiguous hopefully-hygienic substance. In that article, Nit Flex’s Human Outreach and Surveying Them Association (minus Geriatric Elders) (HOSTAGE) was able to provide us with some very satisfactory customer reviews.</p>

<p>However, there was a problem. Hecrenews’s Science and Research department (SAR) ran an analysis on the customers’ comments, and came to a most surprising conclusion: many, if not all of the reviews seemed to be given unwillingly! Sheeple Dunnel, top smarty-pants at SAR, cited Bourd Gourd saying, “Stop the pain” as indicative of something mad sus, and also pointed out Kaker Neran’s saying “You can’t torture me” as a clue that the customers may have been coerced into giving a falsely positive review.</p>

<p>Since the hecrenews is undoubtedly devoted to providing veritable, objective news at a great rate of many articles per day, this was no less than an outrage. How dare Nithin Felix attempt to bamboozle us so! So, just like any other objective news site dedicated to purely informing, we decided to sponsor an insurrection.</p>

<p>You may remember from a prior article that “a team of hacky-types is trying to somehow resuscitate this lost ‘Cancel Subscription’ button in a last-ditch attempt to keep their bank accounts from dipping sharply in the negatives.” You may also have heard that I am so lazy that I’d quote myself rather than typing out less than thirty words. We reached out to the leader of the movement, a SnaxelyLeftButtock_012. Known professionally as Lefty, this h4x0r and a band of others have devoted hundreds of hours to trying to recreate the cancel subscription button, all while their bank balances fall faster than a kilogram of feathers. The hecrenews was fortunate enough to go zooming with these Gettysbird-based hackers whose location cannot be disclosed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>”It’s really hard, you know. Trying to find out where Nit Flex hid their subscription button. They could have put it in the cloud, but we’re a bunch of ragtag hackers, we don’t have that kind of aviation technology. They could have put it in a disc, but we’re a bunch of ragtag hackers, we don’t know anything about 70’s dance fashions. They might have even put it in a drive, but we’re a bunch of ragtag hackers, most of us are legit probably under 16.”</em> - SnaxelyLeftButtock_012</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The self-described “bunch of ragtag hackers” was super close to getting past Nit Flex’s great firewall (they discovered that throwing water at their computers was not the way to go) when disaster struck. HOSTAGE found them, rops. Every last member of the rebellion, taken away to wherever Nit Flex houses its <del>kidnapped people</del>testimonial-givers. I bet they’ll all be <del>tortured</del>questioned rather heavily.</p>

<p>However, HOSTAGE, for all their cold-blooded efficiency, forgot something. Lefty, during the HOSTAGE raid, was able to smuggle a flip-phone with him, keeping it hidden next to that oh-so-snaxely body part of his. And while sandwiched between HOSTAGE operatives in a black SUV, in a final feat of almost inhuman dexterity, SnaxelyLeftButtock_012 was able to break through the firewall and retrieve the ‘Cancel Subscription’ button. But for all of Left’s gluteal prowess, he couldn’t type out the address of his offshore associate, BoneyMeerkat.</p>

<p>Guess who the message containing the all-important location of the ‘Cancel Subscription’ button got sent to? I’ll give you a hint: He gets a kick out of bashing in baboons’ heads.</p>

<p>Oh, those hackers are sooo screwed now.</p>

<hr />

<p>Bruh, Wopps stole the part two of this article. Good thing I can count on his inherent laziness to know that he won’t publish anything else before me anytime this century. Nit Flex’s <del>dungeons</del>Customer Service Center <del>are</del>is probably filled to the brim. It’s got Hooshar Manus, Gordon Oohbeedoo, SnaxelyLeftButtock_012, and who knows how many else inside it. I’m not sure what others are saying about this <del>violation of human rights</del>large-scale testimonial-collection of Nit Flex, but I sure know what my grandaddy would have said: “rat-a-tat-t</p>

    <description>An article about Time Travel Maybe Works?</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So after getting
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/09/06/adalbert-bulstrode-invents-time-travel.html">exclusive access to the world’s first time traveling appartus</a>,
Bulstrode decided to take me back in time to restore my streak. We were only in the machine for about a second and I was ready to step out and restore the honor
of the legendary streak.</p>

<p>The automatic doors of the appartus slowly opened and the fog machine Bulstrode added for dramatic effect began to whirr, and it was quite the suspense. For the
first time ever, I have time traveled. However, disaster struck as I read the date on the large clock. It was September 19th! Almost two weeks had passed since
I first went in, and it all took place within a second. “You promise this machine isn’t just changing the time of that clock?” “I mean, it sorta is because time
travel will move that clock forward.” I checked my own cellphone, which Bulstrode never even took notice of, and time had truly passed.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Bulstrode, “Simply a systematic error. I forgot to calibrate it!” “Bruh,” I said, “That was legit scary.” “Okay get back in, let’s go to September 2nd,
the date the streak was lost.” “I have one question?” “What?” “If we re-write history, will the previous articles get updated?” “First of all, that kind of thinking
only leads to paradoxes and we ain’t gonna deal with them. Second, after studying hard in school I have gained immense wisdom. I predict the website will be too lazy
to update itself, even if time itself was being re-written, the people behind the scenes at the Hecrenews must be big-shots.” “Well our boss sure isn’t.” And
so we went back into the machine, ready to go back to September 2nd. This has been Mister Mjir, popp-</p>

    <title>Candidate cares more about staying alive than his political position</title>

    <description>An article about Candidate cares more about staying alive than his political position</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since he was a young’un, local dyude Gordon Oohbeedoo has wanted to serve his community by being elected to office Every tuesday at four, he would come straight home from Leafblower Elementary (in which the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/28/leafblower-elementary-tensions-escalate.html">situation</a> is pretty dang tense) and hop onto the local political TV channel. Oohbeedoo loved to just watch political candidates debate each other, spittle flying from their mouths, their faces getting progressively redder until the tension of the debate escalated into a fistfight. That usually happened at 5:45, so Gordon was able to watch all the good stuff and still had time to get ready for his weekly bathroom break at 6. From a young age, Gordon Oohbeedoo had developed such strong feelings towards being able to run for a role so that he could be just like his heroes on TV. That was 23.29 years ago.</p>

<p>But sadly, some currently developing news may put an end to Gordon’s budding political career. Streaming corporation Nit Flex (the one that recently made <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/14/local-streaming-service-deletes-cancel-subscription-button.html">news</a> for removing their ‘Cancel Subscription’ button) has released a frankly quite concerning statement. It seems that Gordon Oohbeedoo values his own life far more than his position on snaxing rights. How could someone so obviously indifferent towards a contentious political issue ever hope to be elected. But where did this information come from? To see, we’ll jump back a couple years.</p>

<p>After Gordon finished his high school career, he immediately enrolled in the best law and politics school this side of Chattanooga, Weedwhacker University. Oohbeedoo, being an all around star student, quickly gained the admiration of teachers and colleagues alike. His ideas were great, and he soon gained a following. As a classmate of Gordon’s once said, “He was headed for greatness”. Needless to say, that classmate retracted this quote as soon as he heard of the recent scandal.</p>

<p>Which brings us to (almost) the present day. Gordon was practically a shoe-in for mayor. He was well liked with everybody, and there wasn’t a soul that contested his policy on Snaxing rights. Gordon promised that if he was elected, he wouldn’t put a limit on the amount of Snaxii, and would repeal the previous administrations altogether-quite-stupid catch-and-release program. After all, the more snaxii snaxed, the better. Gordon additionally preached that he would allocate the vast majority of government funds to the research and development of new snaxing tools, including the fabled Mega Sticky Hand of old. Everybody loved Gordon, and everybody loved his policies. That is, except for one Nithin Felix.</p>

<p>For reasons yet unknown, Nit Flex’s Human Outreach and Surveying Them Association (minus Geriatric Elders) (HOSTAGE) gently <em>escorted</em> Gordon to Nit Flex headquarters in a black SUV. Eyewitness account Framella Fronelly claimed that Gordon looked quite appalled (and beaten up) from the back seat of the car, but HOSTAGE assures us that this is not the case.</p>

<p>And then, something downright appalling happened. Two weeks after being seen <del>kidnapped</del>escorted by HOSTAGE, an alarming blog post started to surface. You may recognize the author with the very-concerning name from a previous <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/30/the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-plight-of-hooshar-manus.html">article</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/gordon_oohbeedoo_blog_post.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hopefully he keeps quiet after this post, because every time I read that altogether-quite-deprave name, I die a little bit inside. But this article isn’t about me (if it was, it would be 3x as long and contain multiple flowery odes). Needless to say, Oohbeedoo’s treasonous words (I can’t bring myself to repeat them, even as type) disgusted many of his hardcore supporters, and less-hardcore supporters as well. In effect, basically everyone hated him now. That author with the frankly abhorrible name also went on in a separate post (twice the AdSense!) to detail how Gordon was also recorded to have said: <em>“Please spare my family! I care about them so much more than whatever that script you’re giving me’ll say! Please!”</em> and other equally politically sabotaging statements.</p>

<p>The blog posts had the immediate effect of reversing the changes that Oohbeedoo had worked so hard to achieve. Everywhere, people only took Gordon’s name as invective of the highest order. So much as saying, “Oohbeedoo!”, in a public area was the societal equivalent of reacting Cesium and Water. Yikers!</p>

<p>The election is on the brink, and it would take a great deal more than a miracle for Gordon to redeem himself and actually live up to his childhood dream of being elected. But who knows? Maybe he’ll make a grand <del>escape</del>exit from the HOSTAGE <del>dungeon</del>office on the night before the election (somehow avoiding the lynch mobs patrolling for him) and make a speech with persuasive prowess rivaling persuasive_article.md. Nah, who am I kidding? Have you seen how much the people here love to snaxe? And Oohbeedoo just ferociously attacked it in that very-official statement.</p>

<p>In short, “RIP Gordon Oohbeedoo”, according to the blogger-with-the-unsavory-username.</p>

<hr />

<p>Dang, there was a lot of time-hopping in the beginning of this article. Got to be freaking quadratic storytelling or something. I guess I have <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/09/06/adalbert-bulstrode-invents-time-travel.html">Adalbert Bulstrode</a> to thank for being able to do it, I guess. Legend has it that modern day leaders such as  Anna Džana took inspiration from Gordon Oohbeedoo during his glory days, and for good reason. I wonder what those leaders are feeling right now, seeing that their hero has admitted to caring about himself and his family more than his political views.</p>

<p>Gee, I wonder what Wopps is doing. Haven’t heard from him in a while. Eh, maybe he’s just practicing one of those procrastination techniques Shroops the Mighty taught him. But what do I care about a frankly quite weird sometimes-British bunny rabbit? It’s in times like these that I draw upon the words of my late mother’s father-in-law: “rat-a-tat-tat-tat-t</p>

checking all science kinda stuff and he helped out with many articles. We don’t know exactly when but Bulstrode suddenly disappeared out of the picture. Rumors were
going about he was just studying but we dutiful investigative journalists at the Hecrenews know he was up to something, and he was working on something big.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/11/changing-clock-time-does-not-allow-you-to-time-travel.html">way back in May</a> Bulstrode thought
turning the clocks back was the equivalent of time travel. His friends laughed at him but Bulstrode bounced back and began grinding through all of physics, easily
making his way to the scientists who were making break-through discoveries. Just a few months of non-stop work, and Bulstrode was a master. They say it takes 10,000
hours to become a master at something. That’s about a year and a third and Bulstrode just did it in a few months, probably even less! Today we recieved an email
from Bulstrode saying he discovered something big and called us down to a secret laboratory. The title probably spoils it but I do not know what it is yet, so I
went there.</p>

<p>The laboratory was in a secret place. It looked like just a regular plain field, a nice natural place with lush grass, a pure river, and some mountains in the back.
I walked a few meters in, I had to convert from feet because Bulstrode was a scientist and used the proper units. Units sure are getting weird these days. I should
probably let Wopps in on the scoop of a person measuring car speed in hamburgers per bald eagle, pretty crazy stuff. Anywho, soon the ground under me revealed itself
to be a secret platform, and I was pulled underneath to the secret laboratory. It’s no problem if I share the deets because Bulstrode is gonna destroy the lab
afterwards and convert it back to eco-friendly, a true environmentalist, much better than Ellena Donelly.</p>

<p>I saw the man himself, he looked ruff and the facial hair was there. Uncombed hair and slight eyebags, this mans was working harder than a teenager in high school!
“I did it,” he said. “What exactly did you do?” “See this apparatus here? They called me crazy and said it was impossible, but I did it. Time Travel.” I was in shock,
the mad lad actually did it. “Come on, we gotta save your article streak.” And so I went in, becoming one of the first two people to time travel. This has been
Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out (of time!).</p>

    <title>Mister Mjir Streak Lost</title>

    <description>An article about Mister Mjir Streak Lost</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After arduous work producing articles after articles like a factory machine, I (Mister Mjir), have lost the daily streak. The boss was giving a nice pay increase but
now it will be rescinded after losing this streak. Many there was a time I tried to do a permanent daily streak but it always failed, and every time afterwards when
I did a streak the boss payed less and less. It was still barely more than the regular pay but I may not even get a bonus next streak. This is a major rops.</p>

<p>The journalist life is pretty hard. The Hecresphere is quite large and it’s hard to get equal representation, far more than even posting an article each day. Sometimes
just to keep the streak we don’t even post news but put a letter of the day, and it’s sad to see the Hecrenews regress to such a state. We must continue to strive
higher and aspire more with our ideas!</p>

<p>This historical streak went from July 27th to September 1st. That is just over a month long, pretty impressive and makes you feel old. Strangely enough I feel like
I can’t remember what happened the past few days, if only I could go back in time to see what happened…</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Uh-oh” said Bulstrode. “What’s up?” I asked. “The time travelling is becoming very unstable, I don’t think we have time fore full length actual articles.” “What
happend,” I asked. “So you see we got stuck in time again, so we got to finish these articles fast!” “Guess quality doesn’t matter, just need to regain the streak
at this point.” “Well said, now hurry! We must return to our original time period ASAP!!!”</p>

    <description>An article about How to be a Prolific Writer, by Banana The Human</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yo yo yo(<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/20/due-to-social-distancing-gangstas-have-found-new-and-innovative-ways-to-conduct_shady-deals.html">my name is Baby Joe</a>), I’m gonna impart some great wisdom on you readers today. In fact, I’m probably going to change your lives(Don’t mention it). I’m going to teach you on how to become the Plorificarest-that’s a real word, take my word for it(I’ll drop it off near the shady water fountains near Leafblower Elementary)-writer there ever t’was.</p>

<p>Now there are many good writers, but one thing that good writers struggle with is writing more often. Now, that’s not a challenge anymore for me, because you know, I definitely post a lot on Hecrenews, but for most beginners, it’s a real problem. The way I propose defeating this nemesis(without arson of course), is to write every single day. I mean every single day. It doesn’t matter if it’s good or bad, it just matters that you wrote. Wow, this article is actually starting to sound like a good guide. That’s not good for my competency level, so I’m gonna now give you, the faithful Hecrenews readers, some absolutely useless tips to cement my low credibility.</p>

<p>Tip 1: Use [REDACTED]. It works absolutely super darn good, and has often helped me improve my [REDACTED]. I strongly approve [REDACTED] to all you readers.</p>

<p>Well, that’s it. I know the reader’s might want some actual Banana The Human articles, like the actually decent ones I used to post. Don’t worry, I’ve got some actual no-nonsense solid 100% authentic Banana The Human articles coming in the near future. This is Banana The Human, hopefully only saying goodbye for like a day or two.</p>

    <title>Cheating Club Disbanded as Schools Closes</title>

    <description>An article about Cheating Club Disbanded as Schools Closes</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>d popping. “Bruh, can you let me at least do my closing signature for these articles?” “But it’s kind of better like this so they know it’s part of the time
travel.” “Cannot argue with your point Bulstrode. Lucky for me today I already wrote half of the article, but something happened and I didn’t write the other
half.”</p>

<p>Somewhere in the Hecresphere schools are being closed down to protect the safety of their staff and students. However, as schools close, cheating rates drop to an
absolute 0, because if there is no school there is no cheating. This doesn’t seem like much of a problem but for the local cheating club at
Tigrnonii High School, this is huge, and the club even had to disband.</p>

<p>“Let me clear up some things,” said the club’s leader, who anonymously goes by Alfred Dominigo. “We’re a big name underground school club, we don’t do any of that
legal
school club stuff, and that’s why we have such a good reputation. Underground schools clubs are where it’s at, I’m part of 7 others excluding the cheating club. We
even got a club sponsor and a fake club front. It’s easy, here we learn how to fabricate, so as long as we fabricate legit club activities, the school won’t know
anything!” Dominigo has been leading the cheating club since elementary school. There weren’t clubs in elementary school but there were no restrictions on who could
start a club so he was allowed to. Apparently the club’s front was “Scholarly Research Club,” a club aimed at conducting exper-level research to discover new things
and enrich kids minds. That was all a facade, of course. Really the Cheating Club specialized in training students. This wasn’t any ol’ there’s a teacher in class
teaching you stuff, this was hard-boiled military style training. There was a code of honor which could not be broken, strict discipline was needed, as a mistake
for a soldier could mean death on the battlefield, a mistake for an ADer (Short for Academic Dishonesty) could make their reputation is ruined forever, causing them
to be unable to attain jobs do to their untrustworthiness, leading to a life of poverty and deprivation.</p>

<p>The teachers, other than the sponsor, did not know what was truly happening but those we’ve talked with said the memebrs of the Scholarly Research Club were some of
the best students they’ve seen, and they have great character. Ignoring their grades, they have high maturity, are always helping out other students, and are overall
great to work with. Their streak of straight 100s was suspicious to some teachers, but they wrote it off because the kids behaved so civil. These kids were experts
in communicating. There was a suttle code which changed for each test, information had to be passed between classes and to future classes. Synchronized bathroom
visiting, hand movements, glancing, playing with hair. What seemed like test stress was all an expert conversation. These kids knew how to split up the work. It’s
hard for 20 kids to complete 20 difficult problems, but it’s no problem for 20 kids to finish one problem each, then they just need to transfer the information. It is
genius.</p>

<p>Tests are one thing, and there are many, <em>many</em> methods to cheat, but what about projects? Is it even possible to cheat on those? The Cheating Club knows and the
answer is a solid yes. These kids are a master of plagiarism, but making it look like they didn’t write it. Some teachers call it paraphrasing, summarizing, but these
kids know the truth, and the truth is they are plagiarizing. Teachers cannot crack the code, and they give the benefit of the doubt. For them, it is better to name
a non-innocent innocent than name an innocent as non-innocent, and usually they think the people who are not in the “Scholarly Research Club” are the ones who
are likely to cheat.</p>

<p>We even asked the principal of the school about this, and his response was surprising. “I knew about it. Who do you think I am? I’m the principal of this school,
nothing gets past me.” “Why are you letting these kids commit AD, in other schools this is an act of treason, destroys your GPA, and leaves you blacklisted.” “These
kids are geniuses, and they are developing useful skills in the real world. If the teachers can’t catch them, that’s their problem. I think of it like this. For one,
these kids know teamwork, and that’s important in the work force, where companies complete task which require hundreds of people, so knowing how to work as a team is
key. These students also know how to communicate. You know this takes me back to my own years in high school, this kid got the Student of the Month award for
communication, became the master of communication, and is now a very successful person. Simply being able to communicate will take these kids places. Who needs to
know the mitochondria is the powerhouse of a cell? Not all these kids are going to be doctors, they know how to focus on their goal and take the most efficient path
there, and I can respect that. It’s kind of sad to see the cheating rates drop, but you should know, the cheating rate is only for the people caught cheating, and
that is unacceptable. Cheat all you want, but don’t get caught.” The principal tried to say the wink emoji but we were unable to transcribe that, rops.</p>

<p>This has been your time-hopping journalist, Mister Mjir, poppin-</p>

    <title>Leafblower Board Taken Down</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/09/02/leafblower-board-taken-down.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/09/02/leafblower-board-taken-down.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Leafblower Board Taken Down</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ing and popping out. “And it should have worked,” said Bulstrode. I didn’t even get time to finish the article as we had traveled from September 20th GMT to September
2nd. “Gosh darn, I don’t have the news to tell me what happened today, what am I supposed to write about?” I asked Bulstrode. “Just check the title.” “Ah, good- wait
a minute I didn’t write the title yet, stop imposing your time manipulating skills on my poor brain. You know what? My journalist <em>flow</em> is telling me something is
taking place at Leafblower Elementary, let’s roll out.”</p>

<p>You all know Džana, it’s a home staple at this point. Some see her as a herald sent from a different realm to save the school, and some see her as a trouble-maker
disrupting the local peace. What everyone can agree on is that she is becoming a major force in local politics. If you haven’t caught up you can use the
Hecrenews’ <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/search.html">search feature</a> and that might help.</p>

<p>Džana’s trap for the board has been set. It is so elaborate even I can’t grasp it. The entire student body all had input in it, after all, that’s 500 workers! If we
had 500 people here at the Hecrenews my job would be a lot easier. Anywho I can’t really get the scoop of this trap, but once the board falls into it Džana will
somehow have control of the board. I have no clue how any of this makes any sense but my instincts tell me it’s gonna work. Džana is already president of all the
clubs, but before she can take out the board she needs to take down the school administration. In an organized group effort all the students stormed the admin office,
but to their surprise no one was there. Mr. Karo Cann was nowhere to be seen. Džana went up to Cann’s desk and observed the metal name tent which proudly laid strong
on the desk. Džana then deftly flicked it down and pulled out a brand new name tent, with her name on it, and placed the tent on the desk. The student body cheered, it
was pure bliss. People from all around the city heard these elementary school students’ triumph, their overcome of obstacles in their path, and began to weep joyful
tears. Other principals from around were shook by this powerful statement but remained firm because they weren’t as pitiful of a sight as Mr. Karo Cann. Rumors have
it Mr. Karo Cann has emigrated to Mongolia, where he intends to live as an ibex for the remainder of his life. Now that Džana was the principal of Leafblower
Elementary, she was going to attack the board.</p>

<p>A few hours after the board got info about the Džana-level takeover, they began a meeting to discuss their future plans. In the history of history never before has
a student taken down the principal and became the principal of the school. Some schools have a principal of the day feature, but that is like bring your child to work,
Džana was the legit principal of the school, the school’s website was even updated to reflect this. The board had some major decisions to make, but their plan was to
shut down Leafblower Elementary. Of course, Džana had already prepared for this. Outside of the district school building, where the meeting was taking place, Carl
Mugabe had parked his ice cream van and was harnessing the power of the electromagnetic spectrum to send radio waves to communicate to Leafblower what was going on in
the meeting in real time. Džana was ready to make her move. I was observing from a distance so I don’t really know what went down, but I saw an army of students
storm into the building. It looked like a real battlefield, not even, it seemed far larger. A later interview with some of the students revealed insightful
information, such as, “It was pure chaos, but it was also mad fun,” “You should’ve been there, it was cool,” “We roasted those old people so much,” and “We are the
senate now.” I have no clue what happened, how this 4D chess was being played, but I soon saw the board members walking about of the building all with their heads
down in shame: they had resigned and given control of the board to Džana, who appointed some students to run it.</p>

<p>And so the tensiosn are rising once again. Džana just needs to take down the superintendent, and then she can pacify the students, bring peace to the land, and much
more good stuff. She’s already made history, but she’s not going to stop until she reaches her final goal. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in an- “Hurry, the
time machine is pretty finicky, we have to go to September 3rd now!”</p>

    <title>Trillions in Sorrow and Despair after Death of Beloved Master Oogway</title>

    <description>An article about Trillions in Sorrow and Despair after Death of Beloved Master Oogway</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world mourns today. Trillions across the globe are in sadness. How can so many people be in agreement about the same thing? We do not know but even writing
this article is leaving me in tears. Today the world is mourning the death of beloved Master Oogway.</p>

<p>Today might not even be the anniversary of his death, but his death is not something we should celebrate. Instead, we celebrate his life, as he was the best master
anyone could have have and ask for. We can spend hours talking about his beautiful build, his benevolent heart, his kindess, his wisdom, but I only have time for an
article’s worth and my fingers are starting to hurt from this daily streak (youch!). If you do not know who he is, then you have problems. If you want to learn
more about his history and haven’t seen this yet check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMbdl1Bjdzc">this video</a>.</p>

<p>Master Oogway has truly made a huge impact in our lives. I don’t know if we will get copystriked for including his quotes so I will omit them but be sure you
know all of them! Master Oogway is great, he is greatness. He is not simply up there in big man-ness with Baloo and King Louie, master Oogway is a whole league above
them in big man-ness, and that’s not easy to say knowing how much I idolize Baloo. His death was not asked for, but we knew it was coming. We were going to be sad,
and we didn’t want it to happen. We weren’t going to fight with the flow of the universe, we let him move on in peace.</p>

<p>Oogway passed peacefully, he became one with the universe. Namdas has to say, “I was crying for a whole month and still haven’t recovered after seeing Oogway’s death.
I have to go to dailt therapy and I’m not the only one. There is a long line of about 50 people who need it because it is just so heart breaking. Master Oogway was
like a father to me, I loved him like a son. He gave me so much wisdom, hope, happiness, and I was never able to return the favor. The composition was beautiful and
a perfect fit for the scene. I am happy someone spent so much time and effort into making that and for the conductor and musicians being able to play it the entire
way without breaking out in tears. Oogway’s death was going to happen, but I don’t know when I’ll be able to accept it.”</p>

<p>Namdas and the other people consisting of the trillions all are sharing mostly the same sentiment. I can’t even interview people without a flash flood warning, there
are just that many tears. Oogway is like Ralph because he can see the darkness within man’s heart, but Oogway didn’t need so much carnage to see it. He could see
the prosperous and the darkness, the good and the evil. Oogway taught us patience and good virtues. I cannot even eloquently put together the words which will do him
justice, and I don’t think anyone else can.</p>

<p>As of now we all contniue to weep, for the loss of the truest friend, Master Oogway. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in an- <em>sniff</em> popping out.</p>

<hr />

<p>Hecrenews Article Quality Control (HAC): Apologizes if this article made you sad, it made us sad too but we don’t want to add more sadness to Mister Mjir by
denying this article and causing him to lose his massive streak. We have found that watching cat videos can aid you, but may not heal fully.</p>

    <title>Opposition to Vents gather at Anti Vent Rally</title>

    <description>An article about Opposition to Vents gather at Anti Vent Rally</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a local field hundreds of passionate people have gathered. However, these people are not passionate about what you would expect. These people vehemetly hate
vents. We don’t know why, even SAR (Hecrenews Science and Research) is bamboozled. The leader of the rally, Tivan Ent, is busy telling the masses how terrible
vents are. The evidence doesn’t seem legit, but the people sure are getting rallied up. I could see the energy coursing through their veins all the way from my
safe observation point.</p>

<p>After the rally I got to interview some people so we can get a good scoop, and hopefully HAC (Hecrenews Article Quality Control) can push the boss to increase my wage,
who knows. Guðrún Reijo tells us a little bit of why she hates vents. “It all started when I first asked what was that thing in the wall. I was quite curious back then
so my I asked my parents for some books and started reading up on some facts. It was then I learned about the evils of vents. For one, just look at them. That’s not
an inviting design. One would assume such things only scare little children, but I assure you the people who aren’t scared are just taking it for granted. Not only
are there tons of tinny critteres and bugs living in there, there could be other monsters in there as well. In fact I was reading some stories from
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/17/spooky-tales-from-a-spooky-site.html">this</a> news site and I felt eyes watching me from the vent. Thank goodness
no one knocked on my door, that would have truly been terrifying. Vents are blowing air. Now this may not seem like a big deal to most people but it is. What if
vents decide to blow hot air on a hot day, or cold air on a cold day?” This could seriously be dangerous and the public is just shoving it off like it’s not a big deal.
Together, we can stop this, and end the evils of vents!”</p>

<p>Other participants of the rally seemed to have similar views. “I’ve had to go and remove all 100 of the vents in my house manually,” said Caoimhe Liat. “It’s a pretty
good exercise and helps you with your DIY skills and helps keep you safe from those vile, evil vents. Those dastardous vents have some malicious plans coming up ahead.”
Overall, the rally seemed pretty peaceful. Other time when we see protests or rallies sometimes they brake out into full blown riots, with collateral damage everywhere
so it was good to see a relatively peaceful group for once.</p>

<p>Soon I was able to ask Ent, the leader of the group, for questions. “What do you want people to know?” I asked. “Well, people just gotta know. That’s it. Pretty simple
and easy. Just be aware. Vents aren’t friends, they are enemies. You gotta open your eyes people. We’re not telling you to join our <del>cult</del> organization, we just
want you to start taking action yourself. If we all work together, we can stop a disaster from happening. One of our members is even from the future, and the vents
took over, so he came back to warn us. We need to heed those warnings or else it could be the end for civilization as we know it. If you could do one thing today,
just inform someone new about this. Share and spread the message, that much will be a huge help. If you want to be more involved with helping us then please join our
<del>cult</del> organization, we do a lot of fun activities.</p>

<p>The anti-vents are going to have more rallies and are planning to protest soon once they become more organization and have a little more outreach. Sadly that hasn’t
happened yet so you’ll just have to wait for the next one. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <description>An article about The Terrible, Horrible, no good, very bad plight of Hooshar Manus</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have heard about Hooshar Manus, or even read the article the Hecrenews posted on one of his <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/09/man-invents-device-that-turns-traffic-light-from-red-to-green.html">ingenious inventions</a>. Well, it turns out that Manus has gotten himself into quite the pickle since we last met him, almost three weeks ago. But before getting to that, we should probably go over how Manus’s proposed line of inventions went over. He was indeed able to produce them all and they were delightfully purchased en masse by the masses. However, something most curious happened.</p>

<p>Within about a week and a half, Manus’s fledgling (and yet unnamed) company was faced with a literal flood of returns, threats of litigation, angry letters, and the such. Hooshar couldn’t figure out why. All of his customers seemed to be happy with their purchases just a little bit before. But now, they were all boiling mad. Manus at first tried to pay off the avalanche of angry comments (he was pretty stacked in terms of money, having sold the devices at $5000 + tax eacn). However, there were just too many to negotiate with.</p>

<p>Feeling like some sort of legal action was inevitable, Hooshar Manus hired the Phone Search and Rescue Squad (PS) to try and determine the root cause of this wave of hate directed at him. Although investigating around for root causes wasn’t the PS’s main job (searching for and rescuing phones), they accepted. Between this, <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/27/investigation-reveals-that-womans-birthday-is-on-the-same-date-she-was-born.html">that time they said they would find someone’s birthday</a>, and <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/26/investigation-reveals-that-woman-was-born-on-her-birthday.html">that time they said they would find someone’s birth date</a>, it seems like the PS is one of those “up for anything” organizations, as long as it’s somewhat related to searching or rescuing, or phones in general. Quite commendable, their eagerness to aid others. Or their eagerness to get paid; I’m not sure which is the greater motive.</p>

<p>Anyways, let’s get to the crux of things. The PS looked long and hard. First, they interviewed (at great personal risk) the angry mob protesting outside Hooshar Manus’s new multi-million dollar mansion, complete with gold-plated toilet seats. Apparently, the mob was too rabid to form coherent sentences. Ah well. The PS scrounged around for any type of physical evidence that could drive so many people to such anger. They looked through people’s compost, the shelves of the Soybean Shoppe, and even inside people themselves. After being kicked out of the morgue, the emotionally traumatized members of the PS decided to go virtual. They hacked into databases, visited sketchy person-finder sites, and even were so brave as to click “I’m feeling lucky” while typing random words in the search box. But then, suddenly, when even the forever-perseverant members of the PS seemed to tire, Manus’s hired investigators tracked down the source of the pitchfork-bearing, invective-hurling angry-as-hecc mob outside Hooshar’s residence. It all came from a quaint little blog:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/hooshar_manus_blog_post.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Who knew something, which had only just recently gotten 1000 views, could spark something so massive? Well, the PS certainly didn’t. It took hours of determined searching (and accidental stumbling) to discover it. It seemed that this author-with-a-very-unsavory-username had gotten the help of a couple of bots. The bots would post the accusatory article on many, many social media sites. One thing led to another, and bada bing bada boom, you got yourself a mob. And an angry one, too.</p>

<p>So Hooshar knew what had happened, but he still had to deal with the Molotov cocktails and general angriness awaiting him every time he stepped outside. Still, Hooshar Manus was, almost by definition, a very smart man. He decided to try appeasement. He refunded each and every traffic light device (plus a little bit extra), promising to look into the lag issue. Very generous and all, but it left him penniless. No more mansion, no more gold-plated toilet seats. Hooshar would have to “rough it” for a couple weeks, at least until his R&amp;D team was able to reduce or remove the latency with his devices.</p>

<p>And that was when Nithin Felix joined the chat. You may remember his ruthless yet effective business tactics from <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/14/local-streaming-service-deletes-cancel-subscription-button.html">this article</a> of hector’s. Well, this takes place before that. From his limousine window one day, Felix saw Hooshar Manus just roaming around the streets asking for money, and had quite a thought. If he could get a good testimonial of another CEO, his business would practically skyrocket! So he talked to his Human Outreach and Surveying Them Association (minus Geriatric Elders) (HOSTAGE) and they worked out a plan.</p>

<p>The next day, while Manus was making his rounds of the city, HOSTAGE nabbed him. They left an expertly planted iced lolly on the ground, which Hooshar was incredibly attracted towards. He hadn’t had a good meal in days, you see. If only that <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/16/man-grows-hamburgers-in-his-backyard.html">burger garden</a> hadn’t been ruthlessly attacked by a bunch of bloodthirsty vegetarians! Anyways, he practically scarfed down that iced lolly. But, despite all of his genis, Manus forgot about the resulting brain freeze. While incapacitated, the <del>commandos</del> representatives of HOSTAGE took the oppotunity to <del>kidnap</del> escort him in a black SUV. A couple hours later, Hooshar had recovered from the brain freeze enough to see that he was in streaming service Nit Flex’s personal <del>dungeon</del> customer feedback center. What a predicament!</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, all’s well that ends well. I really hope Hooshar Manus’s story ends well. Maybe the hecrenews will cover it, or maybe the goings-on of Nithin Felix’s personal <del>interrogation dungeon</del> testimonial center will just be too gristly to accurately put into words. Until then, Wopps out.</p>

    <title>Man Wins Speedreading Competition with New Technique</title>

    <description>An article about Man Wins Speedreading Competition with New Technique</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Valtteri Eva was never an avid reader. The only time he enjoyed books were when his parents read him bedtimes stories when he was a young child. Once Eva had to
pick up a book and start reading for himself, he immediately despied it. Books were not concise, they were not getting to the point. There was all this build up
and unwarranted emotional rollercoasters which cause many people to miss the theme. So much time is spent on world-building it takes forever for Eva to figure out
the whole point of the book. Even textbooks are a problem for Eva. “They’re simply too long. If you can’t explain these concepts to a 6-year old, you aren’t doing
it right, and there’s just too much stuff here and a 6 year old isn’t going to understand squat. My pal ain’t take no stock in ducks with faint quacks, I don’t take
no stock in books.”</p>

<p>Eva constantly argued with his English teachers throughout elementary, middle, and high school. By the time he got to colleg ehe was just way too tired to argue with
the teachers and it wasn’t worth the effort. He spent too much time talking about how the book industry needs to change but no one was bothering to listen to “[his]
sound logic,” as stated by Eva. However, one night after hitting the bar Eva’s pals convinced him to join a speedreading competition. Eva had never heard of one
before but instantly was not liking its vibes after seeing the ‘reading’ in speedreading. However, Eva was slightly drunk after hitting the bar so he signed up for it.
Eva was a man of his word and honor so now he had to go an compete. Eva was also a competitive person, he wasn’t just going to enter a competition with no effort
and straight up lose, he was going to work hard and win.</p>

<p>Eva didn’t know where to start. He asked English teachers how to read fast but made no progress. Turns out Eva’s English teachers don’t read fast at all. They read slow.
Eva turned to other speedrunning outlets for advice. Food eating didn’t really translate but soon Eva found video game speedrunning. Eva began his research on
video game speedrunning and learned to do something faster, you need to optimize. Eva was then hit with the revelation. No one had optimized reading yet! Eva was
going to change the game of book speedrunning as the world knew it. He began practicing.</p>

<p>The day of the competition came and Eva was the outsider there. Everyone there was a nerdy bookworm who carried some books with them just for fun to read. One
person read an entire book on their trip to the competition. Eva doubted himself, these nerds were pro book readers, and his aversion to books left him with a huge
advantage, but he trusted his skills. The compeition started and the clock was ticking. The fastest reader and previous champion reader, Dersa Preed, was about to
finish his first book when Eva declared he was done with all ten. These were no easy books. Two were solid textbooks, and the rest were at least 1000 pages each.
This wasd 4 min. into the competition. Eva then had to wait for the comprehension round, this was to ensure people were actually reading the book and not skipping.
Preed was expecting Eva to get all the questions wrong, but Eva got every question right, something never achieved before. Eva had just made history, and began
entering more speed reading competitions. For once in his life he found something exciting and fun. He turned his worst enemy into his best friend.</p>

<p>Preed was super curious on Eva’s revolutionary tactic and just had to no. First Eva declined but Preed was just being too persistent. Eva eventually spilled the beans
and let us in on it as well. “You see, you need to optimize. You can’t just go in and read every single word in the book, you gotta do it efficiently. I just read
a few letters here and there and extrapolate the rest of the book. It’s not too hard, you should try it. With practice anything is possible.” Preed attempted this
but the extrapolation was just too hard for him, Eva was a mircale on a whole other level.</p>

<p>Shout-out to Banana The Human for letting me in on this scoop. I hear he’s doing some mad interviews and will be dropping a mad article eventually. This has been
Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Leafblower Elementary Tensions Escalate</title>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/28/leafblower-elementary-tensions-escalate.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Leafblower Elementary Tensions Escalate</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may remember Anna Džana and her
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/23/student-becomes-president-of-all-clubs-administration-in-panic.html">fast rise to power</a> at Leafblower
Elementary. Know that ever since Principal Karo Cann came in, Leafblower Elementary has become the number one academic school, out ranking all the high schools in the
nation and even practically all the colleges. The students have had enough. They know they shouldn’t be learning that kind of stuff and instead should be having fun.
Džana has mobilized the student body and is ready to take down the local board but there is one big problem in Džana’s way, and that is the superintendent.</p>

<p>The superintendent was a shrewd man, and he liked to impose his dominance. He did not strike when the students were expecting him, so all the students were very alert
during their classes. However, the body of an Elementary Schooler just simply cannot contain that much attention span, and the kids needed to relax during recess.
Džana was getting some ice-cream from Carl Mugabe. If you don’t know about him you may wanna
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/08/mysterious-white-van-parked-outside-school.html">catch up</a>. Mugabe was about to give Džana the coveted soft-serve
when his expression took a dark turn and he dropped his ice cream, not even looking at Džana. The person who just exited the school doors to see the kids was the
superintendent of the school. Džana looked back and began panicking. She was not ready to face of with the superintendent yet, her army of students were busy
re-charging their batteries during recess. “J-J-Jack…” stammered Mugabe in pure shock. “No way, it’s Jack? Daredevil Jack. The only one who can rival King Louie in
the King of the Swingers.” “You know him?” asked Džana. “When I was in kindergarten Daredevil Jack was the most famous fifth grader. The entire school district knew
him. He would go as high as he could on these rusty old swings and jump off, he is a man who knows no fear.” The man in question was approaching Mugabe’s van.</p>

<p>“And what do we have going on here?” said Jack while giving unnerving glances to Džana and Mugabe. “A strange man giving ice-cream to little children? That’s highly
suspicious. You could even get arrested for that.” “I have a permit,” Mugabe countered as he showed Jack his license to sell food, which was even allowed in the
school. “Well well well… looks legitimate. I can’t really stop you there, I guess I’ll leave you be for know.” Džana was unable to move the entire time. In fact, all
students within the near vicinity of Jack were unable to move even the slightest muscle. One kid had tears coming down his eyes because he was unable to close his
eyelids. Jack stayed awhile, took a few more glances to establish his dominance on the children, and went back into the building. “I can’t believe he’s back,” said
Mugabe. “In the middle of my kindergarten year, Karo Cann came and he removed all the fun. Jack was rumored to have chained himself to the swinget, and was carted to
an unknown place. After he disappeared (or graduated) we thought he was gone. Jack used to be a hero, he was the symbol of freedom and fun in schools. Why do we have
to be on the opposite sitde of this war…” “Speaking of war,” said Džana, “We are waging war with the district. We are going to go against the board and the
superintendent, and we are going to establish a new power structure which will ensure more fun.” “I’m just shaken Jack is on the opposite side of this war. My idol is
now my enemy,” said Mugabe.</p>

<p>When school resumed Džana began her plans to prepare for war. Džana had all the smart kids do everyone’s homework, so there were more hands ready to help. The students
began looking for resources. Food, water, armor. A weapons task force was created to supply the students with the necessary equipment and to research effective
means of attack. One group in the task force discovered pens have a lot of power to them thanks to their springs. There is a lot of complex physics involved which
I don’t understand but I have no doubt even the dullest of Leafblower kid’s fully understand. Another group discovered how effective erasers can be due to their
ricochet ability, they are very bouncy. The teachers knew something was mad sus but since everyone was turning in their work and getting a hundred they didn’t have
much for them to do and they honestly didn’t have anything to teach the kids.</p>

<p>Džana began the next phase of her plan. She began letting her trusted teachers in on this. The local teachers were upset of the lack of power they had. They had
nothing to teach the kids so they were pretty much useless. All the teachers were down, and the teachers began to mobilize. Džana was building a trap to ensnare
the board and take their power, and the superintendent would be next. For now, Džana has to create counter-measures and back up plans because she has no idea what
the opposition is planning. Soon she is going to get a spy and with that she will have enough insight to take down the board.</p>

<p>Things are heating up a lot in Leafblower and if you actually read the whole thing it’s not because of the heat. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and popping out.</p>

    <title>Investigation Reveals that Woman’s Birthday is on the date she was born</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/27/investigation-reveals-that-womans-birthday-is-on-the-same-date-she-was-born.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/27/investigation-reveals-that-womans-birthday-is-on-the-same-date-she-was-born.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Investigation Reveals that Woman’s Birthday is on the date she was born</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, we bring to you a very happy ending to what would otherwise have been a very sad story. You see, local resident Ana Tomi is a completely normal, functional member of society, except for one thing: she (prior to the writing of this article) had no clue when her birthday was. Ana, who works at the local Soybean Shoppe, remembers every bit of her childhood life, except the birthdays. “Highly sus”, mused Sheeple Dunnell, head of Hecrenews’s Science and Research team.</p>

<p>Ana didn’t let her lack of knowledge of her birthday bother her. She just kept on keeping on, and strove to be the best she could be, regardless of one single day. How much does a single event that happens every year define you, anyways?</p>

<p>It turns out that your birthday is pretty important. Tomi was prohibited from doing many beneficial things, such as signing up for an email address and creating accounts on many websites. How else was she going to be able to <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/24/man-makes-big-bucks-with-the-help-of-nigerian-prince.html">help a mysterious Nigerian Prince</a>? Or watch Official HBA <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/28/hba-begins-livestreaming-on-streaming-juggernaut-twitch.html">streams</a>? Let’s face it. The internet is a vitally central part of our society, and here Ana Tomi was, blocked off from a great deal of it. And this was nowhere close to being it, by any means. Tomi also tried, but failed to get a driver’s license, passport, and even a birth certificate(duh)!</p>

<p>Without all these essential accounts and documents, it was hard, none can deny that. But Ana pushed through. She walks over three miles to her job and back every single day. She continually lives in fear of immigration officers knocking at her front door because of her non-existent passport <em>(@ICE, pretend you didn’t just read Ana Tomi’s full name)</em>. She even walks to the post office to send actual, physical mail every time she needs to contact someone. Only a madman (or woman) could maintain this lifestyle forever, and yet Tomi somehow manages it. On the plus side, her legs are super strong from walking all that much every day.</p>

<p>Many have said to Tomi, “Why don’t you just, you know, make up a birthday? You’ll be able to have an email account and everything. You could even celebrate your birthday party, after all these years!” In response to this, Ana Tomi was simply aghast. She told hecrenews intern Eif al-Tawa (who’s been on the job longer than I have, yet still is an unpaid intern) the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>”I believe strongly in the principles of Gratitude, Respect, Integrity, and Trust, also called GRIT. To make up a random day and pass it off as my own birthday just would completely violate the principle of integrity. I have a moral code, and it’s my obligation to follow it and not do anything dishonest like choosing an arbitrary birthday for myself. No, thank you.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(While Ana Tomi is certainly steadfast in her morals and should be commended, we at the hecrenews believe that there is no I in GRIT and that if Ana decided to just make a random day her birthday, it would save her a lot of time (and would save me from having to write this article (I’m all about that laziness ting)).)</em></p>

<p>One person that I may have forgotten to mention is Ana’s life long friend, Adalbert Bulstrode. You may remember him from a whole host of hecrenews articles, although he has been quite busy lately. I wonder what that old coot is up to? Anyways, Ana told the hecrenews that it was Bulstrode who finally convinced her to try and find out when she was born. Bulstrode, in a very <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/20/writing-in-all-caps-found-to-be-more-persuasive.html">persuasive</a> way, sent Tomi the following email:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/adalbert_bulstrode_email2.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It doesn’t need to be said that Tomi immediately called up all the investigation organizations she knew to see if anybody would help her in this quest. Sadly, many flat-out denied. “Finding someone’s address, their bathroom schedule, that we can do. But finding a birthday? That’s practically impossible!” said one source, whose name I won’t disclose out of confidentiality.  And so it went, Ana calling and getting denied, again and again until she was about 2/3 of the way through her address book. Ana called up the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/10/phone-on-silent-lost-searchers-cannot-find.html">Phone Search and Rescue Squad</a>(PS), and they accepted!</p>

<p>Although finding a birthdate was way out of their comfort zone (phones (duh)), the PS did not hesitate to delve right into the case. They combed through all manner of sources, including but not limited to gas station receipts, the statistic page of the Florida #$!$!@#$%#@-ers, and a very stinky, shady-looking dumpster.</p>

<p>Within a week, the results were ready. It turned out that Ana Tomi’s birthday was on the same day as her birth date! Ana was ecstatic! The mystery had been solved! Currently, happy as a lamb, Ana Tomi skips 3 miles to work every day. Now that she’s figured out that her birthday is the same as the date at which she was born, all she has to do is figure out when she was born. She’ll finally be able to drive up to the cafe in Mercedes Benz, and much, much more!</p>

<hr />
<p>Whew, article all done. This story may have looked really similar to a <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/26/investigation-reveals-that-woman-was-born-on-her-birthday.html">recently published one</a>, but Hector piled this on me at the last minute, so it’s his fault, I guess. Well, all that’s left is what I’m legally required to say at the end of every article: Wopps out.</p>

<p>Many have said to Tomi, “Why don’t you just, you know, make up a birthday? You’ll be able to have an email account and everything. You could even celebrate your birthday party, after all these years!” In response to this, Ana Tomi was simply aghast. She told hecrenews intern Eif al-Tawa (who’s been on the job longer than I have, yet still is an unpaid intern) the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>”I believe strongly in the principles of Gratitude, Respect, Integrity, and Trust, also called GRIT. To make up a random date of birth and pass it off as my own just would completely violate the principle of integrity. I have a moral code, and it’s my obligation to follow it and not do anything dishonest like choosing an arbitrary DoB for myself. No, thank you.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(While Ana Tomi is certainly steadfast in her morals and should be commended, we at the hecrenews believe that there is no I in GRIT and that if Ana decided to just make a random day her date of birth, it would save her a lot of time (and would save me from having to write this article (I’m all about that laziness ting)).)</em></p>

<p>One thing that I may have forgotten to mention is Ana’s life long friend, Adalbert Bulstrode. You may remember him from a whole host of hecrenews articles, although he has been quite busy lately. I wonder what that old coot is up to? Anyways, Ana told the hecrenews that it was Bulstrode who finally convinced her to try and find out when she was born. Bulstrode, in a very <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/20/writing-in-all-caps-found-to-be-more-persuasive.html">persuasive</a> way, sent Tomi the following email:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/adalbert_bulstrode_email.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It doesn’t need to be said that Tomi immediately called up all the investigation organizations she knew to see if anybody would help her in this quest. Sadly, many flat-out denied. “Finding someone’s address, their bathroom schedule, that we can do. But finding a birth date? That’s practically impossible!” said one source, whose name I won’t disclose out of confidentiality.  And so it went, Ana calling and getting denied, again and again until she was about 2/3 of the way through her address book. Ana called up the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/10/phone-on-silent-lost-searchers-cannot-find.html">Phone Search and Rescue Squad</a>(PS), and they accepted!</p>

<p>Although finding a birthdate was way out of their comfort zone (phones (duh)), the PS did not hesitate to delve right into the case. They combed through all manner of sources, including but not limited to gas station receipts, the statistic page of the Florida #$!$!@#$%#@-ers, and a very stinky, shady-looking dumpster.</p>

<p>Within a week, the results were ready. It turned out that Ana Tomi’s birth date was on the same day as her birthday! Ana was ecstatic! The mystery had been solved! Currently, happy as a lamb, Ana Tomi skips 3 miles to work every day. Now that she’s figured out that her birth date is the same as the date at which her birthday is, all she has to do is figure out when her birthday is. She’ll finally be able to drive up to the cafe in Mercedes Benz!</p>

<hr />
<p>Whew, article all done. This story may have a sequel brewing, but I dumped that on Wopps, so it’s not my problem. All that’s left is what I’m legally required to say at the end of every article: “rat-a-tat-tat-ta”(Grandpappy 17).</p>

    <title>Self Procalimed Plant Whisperer Helps Plants Grow</title>

    <description>An article about Self Procalimed Plant Whisperer Helps Plants Grow</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ramaz Navin discovered a special talent in 3rd grade. His class was growing flowers for their local garden. They were trying to restore habitats and ecosystems on
the small scale. For bees, bugs, butterflies, and other fun little critters (many of the students were too scared to go in to the garden because they did not like
the bigs, but Navin was not of this breed). Navin was growing the usual tuplipa (aka tulip) but his was growing exponentially faster than the other students. The
teacher thought he was doing some mad hax. Navin’s tulip grew so fast the teacher just gave him a new one. Other students were struggling and crying as their plants
died due to a lack of water, fertilizer, and other tasty plant stuff (for plants, I don’t think many homo sapiens are down for eating raw nitrogen, but hey, that’s
just me). The other students asked Navin for help, and after only a week, not only were there enough flowers for the garden, but the school was able to make a whole
forest full of flowerbeds, it was truly a beautiful looking school. Perhaps Leafblower Elementary will be next in line for this Eco sounding stuff.</p>

<p>Switch back to the present day where Navin is a certified botanist, constantly spitting facts on the unqualied self-proclaimed naturalists, such as the notorious
Ellena Donelly who many locals believe to be a quack. With Navin’s skills many forests we de-de-forested as he was able to grow back. He even has the power to grow
back the jungle which existed long ago in the Sahara desert, and that kind of power can change the world as we know it. We asked Navin how he does it and he
was glad to answer us.</p>

<p>“Thanks for having me”</p>

<p>“No problem, It’s all you man, thank you for being a part of this interview. So I wanted to ask the big big big question. How do you do it?”</p>

<p>“Well while I am a certified botanist, I am a self-proclaimed plant-whisperer.”</p>

<p>“Meaning?”</p>

<p>“I can talk to plants.”</p>

<p>“So you are like the elephant whisperer in Elephant Run but with plants instead. That’s actually even better because instead of one species you can talk to all plants.
Is that right or did I miss something?”</p>

<p>“All plats means every gosh darn species in the plantae kingdom, it’s pretty cool.”</p>

<p>“So what’s it like?”</p>

<p>“Well you see plants are very lonely. People rarely talk to them and they’re usually sad all the time. It’s my dream job making so many people happy when I work,
because that makes me happy. All plants I’ve talked to are happy to hav a person talking to them. They don’t get sad and they revitalize, gaining massive amounts
of energy and I think this is why they grow so fast.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be as easy as that.”</p>

<p>“It sure is, but you need to be committed. Realize that many plants have a distrust of humans due to how terribly they treat them. Most are indifferent and only
a very few care. But you can’t just talk to them, you gotta talk to them like they’re a real person, like a friend.”</p>

<p>“Well that’s amazing. Any closing words you would like to leave the audience with?”</p>

<p>“Try growing a plant today. Just one is enough. Just try it, you may like it and you can make someone’s day, even if that someone is a plant.”</p>

<p>Well that’s an interview. Not even that long but I’m too tired to continue writing. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Grandma Prepares to Roast 6 year-old in Video Games</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/24/grandma-prepares-to-roast-6-year-old-in-video-games.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/24/grandma-prepares-to-roast-6-year-old-in-video-games.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Grandma Prepares to Roast 6 year-old in Video Games</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kumari Suzan is an old woman clocking in at 87 years, and she’s proud of her age and massive wisdon. Suzan’s children and grandchildren came over on the weekend as
usual, but her grandchildren did something which really upset her. She was asking her grandchildren what they were doing and they were busy playing some online games
on their computer, “Oh Grandma, we’re just playing some video games, you wouldn’t understand.” Now Suzan was a very wise woman, and she knew about all the latest video
games and all that, although she never played them because she was busy doing grandma stuff. Rocking in her rocking chair, baking the most delicious cookies in the
world, just being smart, and roasting the community children. Suzan was so upset by this she immediately ordered a gaming rig from amazon. She gave her sweet
goodbyes to her grandchildren and waited for her order to arrive.</p>

<p>Suzan didn’t know much about computers, but she read them manual (a proof of her age) and figured it out within seconds. Now that’s one impressive grandma. Suzan soon
was able to boot up windows, and now she had to hook up her computer to the internet. While most adults and zoomers struggle with hooking up a computer to a printer,
Suzan was able to set up her internet and even used an ethernet cable to get faster speeds, something most 6 year old gamers wish they had. Then Suzan went to the
hot and trending gaming services and downloaded all the hot and hip games. Suzan immediately began grinding. Of course with Suzan’s wisdom, she was staying healthy
doing 5 push-ups every time she died and taking a 20 second break to look 20 feet away after every 20 minutes. She took regular breaks to eat some food and even
meditated in between to keep her mind sharp. Suzan was climbing up the leaderboard in the first game. After simply a day, Suzan was ranked number one in the world,
and it would take about a year for the number two person to catch up so Suzan went to the next game.</p>

<p>By the time her grandchildren came back Suzan was ranked number one in literally all the video games in the world. Suzan was listening in on her grandchildren who were
talking about how they were getting demolished in all games by a player named SweetCookies69420. In factm SweetCookies69420 became the next trending meme legend, even
surpassing the Legend 27, who went back into the shadows after only a little bit in the spotlight. Suzan acted unsuspected, asking her grandchildren what they were
doing. She then asked if she could play with them and they reluctantly said sure, thinking their Grandma didn’t even know how to send an email. Suzan booted up
her computer and her grandchildren were there telling her how to play. First they taught her the tutorial and then they played a ranked match, hoping to destroy their
grandma to overcome the grief of losing to SweetCookies69420. However, the grandchildren were overcome with fear as they saw the matchup, they were up against the
legend himself, SweetCookies69420. It was then the grandchildren looked at their grandma’s screen and realized it was not the legend himself, but the legend herself:
their very own grandma was SweetCookies69420. The grandchildren were obliterated in the game, and they learned their lesson.</p>

<p>No longer would the grandchildren keep grandma out of their affairs and say she can’t keep up with the times. They realize their grandma is a super smart and capable
person, and enjoy having conversations with her and love her enough more. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Student becomes President of All Clubs, Administration in Panic</title>

    <description>An article about Student becomes President of All Clubs, Administration in Panic</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leafblower Elementary school may look like just a regular elementary school on the outside, and it is. A place full of unique individuals, although students at
Leafblower Elementary are particularly brighter than most other kids. Whatever your opinions are on Leafblower Elementary, you cannot deny the amount of attention
they are getting. We first noted them for <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/08/mysterious-white-van-parked-outside-school.html">Carl Mugabe</a> but more
was to come as <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/27/billa-the-rise-and-fall-of-an-undergound-school-organization.html">Billa</a> had quite the
interesting story as well. Today’s focus will be on someone who has the ability to turn the entire school system upside down. This student is Anna Džana.</p>

<p>Džana did not know much about real world politics. It was easy to turn off her brain as the old angry people were roasting each other on television, and that’s how
see saw elections. There were some old people all shouting and making bold claims and it was not interesting to her at all. Džana was not one to read the news, she
was an Elementary school student after all, “What kind of nerd reads the news?” she said. Despite her aversion and apathy towards real world politics, Džana was a
natural at it. Of course she wasn’t running for the Presidency, but there was a lot of power to be had in school. At first she wasn’t to hot about school clubs,
“Why do we even have clubs? We’re an Elementary school. We’ll get clubs at the middle and high schools,” she said to us and her friends but one friend convinced Džana
to join the student council. Džana was disinterested of course but her friend told her to run for president. For some reason, Džana suddenly became interested in the
organization. She was going to run for president, and she was going to win. The other candidate were cold-blooded seasoned veterans, being in the student council since
its inception in 3rd grade and never letting go of their positions. Džana wasn’t even trying to target their weakest member, she was going straight for the Presidency.
Giman B., the current president, thought Džana wouldn’t even pose a minor threat and doubted she would get more than 2 votes. However, Giman B. greatly underestimated
Džana’s charisma and her ability to communicate with the student body. It was as if Džana was a siren when she was rallying up the students to vote for her. Giman B.
soon got insight that he was going to lose the presidency. He played hard and rough, resorting to many underhanded tactics and even blackmail, but he lost the
presidency. The former power structure of the student council immediately collapsed and Džana was president.</p>

<p>At this point in time the adminstration did not even notice anything was wrong. They thought, “Eh, these are just Elementary kids. We show up, they show up, we get
paid!” but they couldn’t have been more wrong. Džana soon began an interest in other clubs. It was not that she craved power but she was a multi-talented kid suited
to be the president of all the clubs in the school. All the sports club, the nerdy clubs like chess and maths, the <em>cool</em> clubs like literal gang club, gaming club,
and other various clubs like underwater basket weaving. At this point the administration noticed Džana’s influence, but they were too late in their realization. As
uncontested president of all the clubs in the school, Džana had an incredible amount of power, and you may be wondering, what is power? In government courses, power
is the ability to make someone do what you want, and Džana could easily do this. Džana had more power than the principal, Mr. Karo Cann. Cann was starting to get
worried. His first slip up was removing fun from the school but Mugabe was there to satisfy the kids so they did not revolt. There was no one to stop Džana though,
she could easily mobilze the entire student body to do as she wishes. Her charisma was so powerful she even influenced the other grades. Under Džana, grades were
solid 100s and the teachers had to bring in top-level professors to make the tests. They tried to make the tests almost impossible but the students were so smart
everyone aced it flawlessly. Cann knew he was the next target.</p>

<p>It soon happened. Towards the end of the first semester, Džana rallied up the student body, “We don’t need the principal, Karo Cann more like Karo Cann’t. He
hasn’t been able to do a single thing for us, why should we have such an incompetent principal. It’s not just him either, our teachers have nothing to teach us
so they are calling in professors from the universities. Why should the teachers teach at our school then. My people, I’m calling for a revolution, and I will need
the help and support of each one of you.” Cann was in pure fear. He spent the last night at the bar drinking his sorrows away knowing something was going to happen
soon and now it happened. Cann took drastic measures and contacted the big bosses. The school board and the superintendent, some of the most powerful people in
the whole business. It would be the first time the superintendent ever stepped foot in the school, as he was so busy with his stuff. It will not be an easy fight
for Džana, but knowing her she has a plan.</p>

<p>That’s the latest we got on that story, seems like some big events are going to unfold soon. There is going to be a huge war, maybe as big as the veg vs. non-veg
calamity. Who knows? Anywho, this has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Concerned Mothers’ Organization Spits Verses Without Curses</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/23/concerned-mothers-organization-spits-verses-without-curses.html</link>

    <description>An article about Concerned Mothers’ Organization Spits Verses Without Curses</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent news, a Concerned Mothers’ Organization has branched out into the music scene by creating a hit new group: Verses Without Curses (called VWC by hardcore fans). The group, devoted to producing curse-free songs and being good role models in general, released its first album just last week. The Hecrenews called up its resident music analyst, Icy Byoit, to comment on  Verses Without Curses’s work.</p>

<p>Byoit gave every track a good long listen, from “Don’t Run With Scissors” to “It ain’t Cuul to Juul”. According to him, a song is best reviewed after one listens to it multiple times. He calls it the bYoit mEthod to succEss in music criTicism (YEET). According to it, all music reviewers should explore a song in three passes. First, they should listen to the song as normal, to “introduce themselves to the song”. After the first pass, the ideal music critic would listen to the song with a background ambience of pots clanging, kids screaming, and other sources of cheeky stuff to “familiarize [themselves] with how the song will  be listened to by the average human”. Finally, Icy Byoit recommends that music analysts listen to the song a third time, but this time at 0.25x speed. This is in  order to “listen from the perspective of those whose brains work faster than those of normal human beings”.</p>

<p>In Byoit’s own words, “My YEET is the best, and some would say the only method to appropriately criticize music. Indeed, several burgeoning critics have cited YEET as “an instrumental source in my music criticizing career”, according to a local who didn’t  offer his name.</p>

<p>But enough about Byoit and his YEET. After properly examining each song in VWC’s album, Byoit surprisingly gave the album a solid 8.5/10. Extremely high praise. Perhaps VWC is onto something. Byoit especially enjoyed the “instructive value” of tracks such as “The Powerhouse (of the cell)” and “Look Both ways before Crossing the Street”. Once again, very impressive ratings. According to Byoit, lead guitarist Karen Kringle really “gave it her all” on the solo inside “a^2 + b^2 = c^2”.</p>

<p>Verses With Curses also has several songs in the album in collaboration with other artists, such as hit swag-rapper ChopOn. Here’s an excerpt from their most viewed song together, by far.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>ChopOn</em>:   <br />
Christion Christion, it’s the only word I know           <br />
Christion Christion, don’t you wish you had this flow   <br />
Before I knew the sacred truth I used to be down low   <br />
But now because of Jesus Christ I’m rolling in that dough!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>VWC(together)</em>:     <br />
Red and green, red and green, best holiday there can be     <br />
Red and green, red and green, we believe <del>work makes you free</del></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite a banger, no? For more hip tunes you can always visit VWC’s website <a href="https://tinyurl.com/abcde">here</a>. The band has also recently announced that they’ll go on tour. I don’t know how that’ll work out because of the whole quarantine thing, but they’re free to try, I guess.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, that’s all for now. Who knows, maybe Verses Without Curses will remain a permanent fixture of the local music scene. All we know now is that they procrastinate less than <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/03/music-group-recieves-backlash-on-song-delay.html">this group</a>. Wopps out.</p>

(the, a, and an) you should be able to flex on your English teacher and ace your sentence parts quizzes. Good luck to all of you out there, this has been Mister
Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>100th Article Special</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/22/100th-article.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/22/100th-article.html</guid>
    <description>An article about 100th Article Special</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cannot believe it! This is our 100th article. Now this is a huge milestone. In this watershed moment we are going to talk about all the histories of the Hecrenews, going to be some good stuff in here. Once again I would like to remind you the Hecrenews puts its readers first, and we are always aiming to improve our reader’s experience. We are not like other news sites with juicy headlines and fake news but instead, we have the most reliable news in the Hecresphere. Enjoy.</p>

<p>About September 3rd, 2018, the very first Hecrenews development began. Back in the day all the HBA run websites were one website within <a href="https://hecrenet.github.io">the Hecrenet</a>. Although, it did not look like that and sadly the old Hecrenet is not available on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a>. However, the code was not good and it was too tedious to add any articles, so the Hecrenews stopped development.</p>

<p>The HBA was determined to revive the Hecrenet, as the Hecrepedia was recently revamped giving it many more features from the old 1.0 version. Sadly the Hecrepedia does not really get updated much these days, very sad. A lot of the information still needs to be copied over. On about April 5th the Hecrenews started its renewed development and with a lot of resources invested, the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/04/10/hello-world.html">first article</a> was posted on April 10th.</p>

<p>The early days were pretty rough. Posting daily was not a trend at all but starting on May 10th there were pretty consistent upload frequencies. Mister Mjir started posting since the second article on April 11th, Whoops dropped his first on May 10th, and Banana the Human started on May 20th. You may notice we have other authors, including Hector, but these three were the pioneers of the Hecrenews. There was a dark age from the end of June till July 26, with very few uploads. On average, an article was posted barely every five days. So sad.</p>

<p>However, a beacon of light came shining through. This boss of ours announced a daily article regime, and Mister Mjir really took it to heart. From July 26 to date, man’s posted an article every day. Quite commendable. Even the rest of the og author gang stepped up, with Wopps Minor posting every now and then and Banana the Human making a comeback on August 3rd.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Hecrenews <del>inducted</del> hired a new author on that very same day to replace Banana the Human if the need arose. Well, that definitely didn’t happen, and the new author, Hector, joined the writing team for good. Once you get past the constant allusions to that paternal forebear of his, he’s a pretty cool guy.</p>

<p>And that brings us to the present day. What now? Mjir refuses to let go of his streak, and Wopps, Banana, and Hector are all posting regularly. <em>(Banana tells me in the background that he does not, but let’s just pretend he does for the sake of hoopla)</em> There’s even been hints of a rival news site, but for now, that remains to be seen. Maybe the small conflict will escalate into a horrible feud, with bloodshed on either side? Who knows?</p>

<p>The Hecrenews is bigger than simply its authors and the boss. We have a multitude of teams here at the Hecrenews ensuring our content is top-notch. Hecrenews Article Quality Control (HAC), Hecrenews Science and Research (SAR), Hecrenews Crime and Punishment (CAP), Hecrenews Analytics Team (HAT) and the Hecrenews Historical Team (HAT) (although the former is probably now a part of HAC while they figure out a new acronym), English and Reading Team (EAT) and more are being added and improved all the time. Many people are working behind the scenes making this a big team effort.</p>

<p>Of course we are not just going to talk about us but also our fellow viewers! What would we be without our loyal readers who read every article intently without fail <em>(hint hint)</em>? May 7th marked the first time Hecrenews reached an audience outside the United States, and since then we have been reaching more and more countries in the effort to ensure all denizens of Earth(and beyond) can obtain access to the best news source in the Hecresphere.</p>

<p>But all of this talk of history is getting boring. How should we celebrate this momentous occasion? 100 articles is  no easy feat, after all. It took hours of pain, toil, and effort, from our very first article on April 5th to– oh no, I’m starting to talk about history again. How about just a hard cut to the next topic?</p>

<p>To celebrate, the Hecrenews threw a big big party, and everybody was there. All of our employees (who were required to come or their pay would be docked) were there, at least. The tracks were banger <em>(thank the planner!)</em> and the entire party  was quite wild. The boss was going crazy with his monocle, lassoing it over his head and catching the unsuspecting Hector’s hoopla juice cup and promptly spilling it all over Hector’s one of a kind S-Shirt(there were also several monocle shaped bruises dealt out over the course of the party, but hey its a party).</p>

<hr />

<p>So, that was quite a fine experience, and this is quite a fine article, if we do say so ourselves. Might even be  better than that three-part article series that’s been going on lately. Anyways, here’s to many, many more articles, brought to you by the most reliable news source this side of Chattanooga! This has been the collective hive-mind of the Hecrenews, popping in and now poppi</p>

<hr />

<p>This is a pretty good article as well.
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/20/super-cool-article-part-1-of-3.html">Hector made a nice article about another article</a> but since he’s taking
a while to upload and because I ran out of ideas I’m gonna steal his series and hop on the train. This is a pretty cool article and we only have one more left, can
you guess what it is? I would like to write more but I already wrote a whole article’s worth of content, I’ll let you be this time around. This has been Mister Mjir,

    <title>Loss of Consciousness Lessens with the Return of School</title>

    <description>An article about Loss of Consciousness Lessens with the Return of School</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our loyal readers are aware of a major crisis science has been unable to solve so far.
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/23/billions-report-losing-consciousness-for-unknown-period-of-time-last-night.html">billions are losing consciousness</a>
each night and no one knows why. However, one organization has been able to mitigate these effects and help people stay conscious longer. These organizations, heroes
of our time, are known as schools.</p>

<p>Schools are an instititution all students are requried to attend to by law. Although some kids do homeschooled, the vast majority of students will go to a public
school, and some fancy kids even go to private schools. Schools are lead by a principal, assistant principal(s), conselors, teachers, and a lot more staff on hand to
serve their students. Schools are part of a district, which may not be the same as one’s city district. All districts have a superintendent, who is basically the
biggest of the boss. There are also boards of educations and boards of trustees and a lot more but it’s cooler to leave those in the shadows because it makes them
more mysterious and more cooler that way (you can thank me later).</p>

<p>We decided to head up to Leafblower Elementary and ask their principal, Mr. Karp Cann, what school is all about. “School is all about learning. All of us are students
for life, we are constant learners wether you believe or not. At Leafblower Elementary we not only teach our student academics, but strive to provide social support
for our students and help then when we can. Our students are our number one priority and we truly love and care about them.” We then asked some of the students
about their opinions. The students we interviewed were not comfortable with sharing their names, but what they say is their honest opinion. “Don’t listen to that
principal, he’s an old quack,” said one student, “He removed our swingsets and took away everything that was fun from us. He started confiscating our phones, beyblades,
and trading cards! I would understand if he took away people’s Pokemon cards but he even went after Yu-Gi-Oh! and Magic The Gathering players. This is not just
horrible, this man is committing crimes! Mr. Carl [Mugabe] is the only reason why I can stand attending this school. He’s made my life so much better by providing
free ice cream during recess. Mr. Carl is a good person, I think he should be the principal of our school.” This student may seem like an outlier, but it turns out many
students share this sentiment. They are unhappy with the current state of their school and want reform. The understand words like reform and confiscate, this is not
normal for Elementary school students. While parents are impressed they are looking at their students grades, not their emotional health. “School should be about fun,”
said one student, “Learning can come second. If we can’t have fun at school, then there’s no point. I understand there’s a limit to fun, but there’s also a limit
on the restrictions of fun. These are unreasonable demands, this is tyranny!” These students formed a coalition and their slogan is “Unity or Tyranny!”</p>

<p>Anywho, to get into the meat <em>(EDIT by HAC: yum)</em> of the topic, the method schools use to reduce the loss of consciousness. It is hideous but the results are true. Schools bombard their
students with loads upon loads of homework. “I have no idea how I still have a C” said the top student at a local middle school. She gets 100 on all assignments,
but only from those she turns in.” “We are so focused on our grades it’s impossible to lose consciousness. I do feel bad for the students at schools like
Leafblower Elementary, but at least schools are solving a huge world problem. I don’t forsee myself losing any consciousness until winter break.”</p>

<p>And there you have it, the top student pretty much summed it up. Schools give homework and students are so focused on the grade instead of the learning they cannot
lose consciouseness. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <description>An article about Man Struggles to Read a Book</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amiran Navdeep faced a terrible dilemna today. During his meeting at work he had to read his presentation notes because he did not prepare his presentation beforehand
and was just winging it. His boss wasn’t paying that much so he did not think about putting much effort into the meeting (Hecrenews authors can relate). Navdeep’s
major problem was his inability to read the notes.</p>

<p>Now you may remember a few months back
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/22/man-sues-book-for-not-having-images.html">someone sued a book because it lacked pictures</a>. I guess this is
similar to that but hey, a new day a new story as they say. Navdeep’s problem was a little strange. He couldn’t read his notes and completely failed his presentation,
recieving diapproving looks from his boss and his co-workers and they had their ace staff member do Navdeep’s presentation although he also didn’t have notes but he
aced the prsentation because he was the company’s ace member after all. Gosh darn, a more interesting article would’ve been how this mans was able to conduct the
presentation on the fly without having any preparation beforehand. I guess I’m stuck with this article for now rops. Anywho, when Navdeep went back to sit down and
look at the report for the next group’s presentation, he was able to read it clearly. He wasn’t like Sture who was unable to read at all because the book didn’t have
pictures, for some reason he could not read his notes. The meeting lasted an egregious 5 hours and everyone was barely awake. The company’s ace member had survived
by taking a dangerous amount of coffee and the boss was knocked out, completey dozed. The next morning everyone woke up in the meeting room and work wasn’t supposed
to start yet so Navdeep asked his fellow workers about it, and the results were shocking.</p>

<p>Navdeep’s notes were easy to read. They were so clear and concise and well-written even a 1st grader could have done his presentation masterfully. Navdeep was getting
so distraught over this he had to leave the office to go and see a therapist. The therapist was unable to identify anything wrong, Navdeep’s reading abilities were
“top-notch” as she put it. Navdeep then went to the local elementary school for consulting and the ELAR team could not find anything wrong with Navdeep. Navdeep was
flabbergasted. He does not know why. He went home and did his daily reading of 30 min. but the phenomenom struck back. He could not read the book at all. He
immeidately called someone while still holding the book in one hand, who did he call? I don’t know, and neither does he!</p>

<p>Within a minute the reliable pizza man came to check out what was wrong. Now it is rumored (by Navdeep) the pizza man is a genius. He told him the secret to his
problem. “My man,” said the pizza man, “you ain’t holding that book right. That thing’s upside-down!” “What the,” said Navdeep as he turned the book a solid
180 degrees. Magically, he could suddenly now recognize all the text, it was making sense, he could read it! “You are my hero!” said Navdeep as he paid the pizza
man the equivalent of a large pizza. The pizza man told Navdeep he didn’t have to pay but Navdeep was persistent on paying him for his deeds as a hero. Looks like
the local pizza man is a life-saver.</p>

<p>In other news it looks like Adalbert Bulstrode is making some strides in a newest discovery, stay tuned.</p>

<p>Hohoho looks like article quality plummets when you’re on a ten minute grind to reach arbitrary deadlines to ensure your streak survives. This has been Mister Mjir

    <title>Massive spike in Cyberbullying from Last Century</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/19/massive-spike-in-cyberbullying-from-last-century.html</link>

    <description>An article about Massive spike in Cyberbullying from Last Century</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s that time of year again! The hecrenews’s centennial cyberbullying roundup survey has just finished, and the results are most surprising. The most interesting finding by the Hecrenews SAR (Science and Research) division was that cyberbullying as a whole has had a massive increase from the last century. So sad, don’t you think? I think so. I think that this is not a very good result. Cyberbullying is not cool, no thank you, so we really do need to do something about this massive spike in recent times.</p>

<p>Now, all article length-padding aside, here’s the methodology of the survey (I was about to publish this article without this section, then Chief of Science and Research (SAR) Sheeple Dunnell came knocking at my door to tell me to hold up. I guess it’s important for people looking for faulty conclusions or something? Anyways, the study hand-selected a specific group of HBA members known to frequent a local non veg eatery between the hours of 8 to 9 pm, so you know that the results are representative of pretty much anyone, anywhere.</p>

<p>Participants (willing or not) were <del>forcibly interrogated</del> asked about their past history with Cyberbullies. Some of the questions subjects of the study were asked to answer were: “Were you cyberbullied today?”, “How much time do you spend thinking about cyberbullies”, and “On a scale from 10-10, how attractive is the person interviewing you right now?” This survey has been going on for the past couple of weeks ago. The data for the 99 years, 11 months, and 6 days that SAR didn’t interview people for was <del>fabricated</del> extrapolated based on the given, definitely legitimate trends.</p>

<p>The collection of smarty-pants affectionately called SAR was so kind as to provide me with a graph of their findings. On the y-axis we have the Level of Cyberbullying, measured customarily by the unit of CBs (Computer-Baddies). And on the x-axis, is the number of years since 1920 (the date that we would have held our last cyberbullying survey, if we’d existed then). Unfortunately, the guys at SAR seem to have adopted us writers’ trend of procrastination and laziness, so neither axis is labelled. You’ll just have to take my word for it, I guess:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/cbs_vs_years_since_1920_graph.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>After collecting the data came its analysis. The good people at Science and Research put the survey data through their time-tested model to check for a correlation. This model, obtained after <del>minutes</del>months and <del>minutes</del>months of speculation and careful research<del>and typing random funny-sounding numbers</del>, tested to see if the amount of cyberbullying had gone down over time (as shown by the negative sign on x1). The correlation for this model (r^2 value for those enlightened ones) was an astounding approximate -0.01. If you solve for r by taking the square root of both sides, r would be either plus or minus 0.1 i. Taking the square root of a negative number means that the result is imaginary– I learned that nifty detail from my time in the Math Corps. Since the correlation was imaginary for cyberbullying decreasing over time, this must mean that cyberbullying had increased, reasoned the geeky ones. Sounds like spotless logic to me!</p>

<p>Whatever could have caused this massive spike in cyberbullying?? Experts disagree, but one major opinion is that cyberbullying rates skyrocketed because of the invention of the computer and virtual things in general. Still, we may never have a definitive answer to this question. In other words: “Eh, who knows?”</p>

<p>So, what to do now? Well, there’s two ways we can go about fixing this problem. We can either fix the problem ourselves by ELIMINATING all cyberbullies, or we can raise awareness about the issue so that they slowly disappear by choosing to act different. Personally, I think the first method has a lot of merit but Wopps once told me that doing those kind of things puts a lot of stress on the one-man legal department of the Hecrenews, and I wouldn’t want to do that.</p>

<p>How can we prevent cyberbullying? Well, here’s an excellent <a href="https://melnewzers.blogspot.com/2020/07/how-to-stay-positive-when-people.html" target="_blank">article</a> that will tell you how to bounce back, if you feel bullied or demotivated in any way. Quite a piece of work, if I do say so myself. Yup, definitely check that stuff out. Very good things in there.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, that’s all done. See you next century! I’ll leave you with the all-too-true words of my paternal granddaddy: “rat</p>

    <title>What is Cereal?</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/18/what-is-cereal.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/18/what-is-cereal.html</guid>
    <description>An article about What is Cereal?</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is cereal? Is it a soup? Is it a salad? Are you supposed to put the milk in first or the ceral in first? This mysterious food item gets consumed by children
all across the world and many take it for granted. Few people actually know what it is. Today we will attempt to answer many of these questions, and we may not get
true confirmation until HAC or SAR reviews this article. Despite these hurdles I will attempt to do my best in determining the mystery of this trending breakfast item.</p>

<p>I guess to do this like how SAR would do it I would have to analyze some of the properties of salads and soup. First another distinction must be made: what is the
difference between a soup and a stew? Thankfully, unlike the SAR, I’m not a professional so I don’t need to cite my sources and can use quick google searches to find
out juicy information. So the difference between a soup and a stew is the amount of liquid it contains. A soup is more “liquidy” or more watery than your local stew,
and you might additionally find more vegetables (or/and other ingredients like meat) in a stew than in soup, but this could vary. Something similar to a stew is a
curry, but a curry does not really mean anything as it’s a general, very vague word describing various gravies and sauces used in foreign cuisine. Now we won’t dive
to deep into sauces (I hope) but there is also gravy, but let’s just go with gravy is a sauce for now. Sauces could be similar to soups/stews, but a sauce is a
seasoning, something you put on top of your meal. But here’s the deal with this, sauces are usually heated up, boiled even with the solid food matter in them. So the
question is do you add warm milk to your cereal or do you heat up your cereal and milk on a stove or in a microwave?</p>

<p>How about a salad? A salad is a mixture of food. Sauces don’t have ‘liquids’ per say but can contain sauces. So plain cereal is not a salad, because a salad needs to
have multiple food types in it. Some cereals decide to go the extra healthy route and include everyone’s favourite, fruits! so if you eat your cereal without milk
and it has strawberries or blueberries then you might be looking at a salad. However, it may be a requirement to have a green substance in the salad. By substance I
am talking about something which is probably a leaf, lettuce being the most common one. By no means am I a salad, or even food expert, but when I think of salad I
picture lettuce. However, one cannot forget about the fruit salad! The fruit salad typically does not consist of a green leaf item, but it is still a salad. With
this definition, no milk cereal with some fruits (maybe even veggies if you’re a madlad) might be considered to be a salad.</p>

<p>So far we have talked about multiple forms of cereal, but it is starting to get off topic. We need to ask the real big questions. Let’s just focus on a standard cereal
(which was determined to be standard by a survery I asked SAR to conduct on the locals). A bowl, milk, and cereal. Yes, cereal is in cereal. Cereal will refer to
cereal as a whole and the other cereal refers to simply what you get in a ceral box. Super intuitive, I know, you can’t have my autograph yet. To make this, one
must combine the bowl and cold milk from the fridge along with some cereal from the bag from the box. Did you heat it up? No, so it cannot be in the soup or stew
family. Is there a liquid? Yes, so it cannot be a salad. It seems there is only one conclusion to come to at this point. Your everyday cereal, is just cereal. Yep,
that’s right. We just answered one of the biggest questions. I hope SAR (Hecrenews Science and Research) approves of this article.</p>

<p>Now the question remains? What do you put in first: the cereal or the milk? Some experts say it’s the bowl but we will have to come back to it another day. This
has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Woman Refuses to drink Water because of Sus Origins</title>

    <description>An article about Woman Refuses to drink Water because of Sus Origins</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anneliese Verginia has caused local storm for refusing to drink water due to “mad sus origins” as one neighbor put it. People across the nation drink water without
thinking too much about it. Some are slightly more cautious than other and buy purified water or a filter for their tap water. Some make sure only to but the top-notch
bottled water infused with rich minerals and energizing electrolytes. However, Verginia is too suspicious of her water and to understand why one must go quite a while
back. It all started in 3rd grade.</p>

<p>Before being midway into 3rs grade Verginia was like most people and did not pay much attention to her water. She knew it was necessary to survive but did not have
the insight of an older person knowing about water sources such as ground water, lakes, treatment plants, and the water companies that send the water to you.
Verginia was actually more healthy than most people drinking water throughout the day and always drinking at least 6-8 cups. Combined with a diet full of fruits and
veggies, the future was looking bright for Verginia. However, one day in science class her teacher began teaching the students about the water cycle. This is the cycle
in which water is renewed and reused. Most of the water in the planet is reused, and rarely do we get an increase via foreign entities such as asteroids.</p>

<p>A water cycle is not a type of bike; however, you can think of the water cycle as the wheels on a bike, as it keeps on going round and round. If you’ve never heard of
the water cycle or need a quick refresher, here is a handy-dandy image to fill you in on all the details:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/water_cycle.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So you have collection, which isn’t included in this image but instead percolation. Percolation is the movement of water through the soil into a ground water source.
Collection is a process in the water cycle where water is, you guessed it, collected! Ever seen a lake or a pond, maybe an ocean? Those are all examples of collection.
The water will eventually come down there but let’s talk about the next steps and come back to collection. There is also evaporation. Evaporation is when the water
gets real hot and the energy added changes its state of mater into a gas, now it’s water vapor, and it flies into the sky like an airplane. A step that is similar to
evaportaion is transpiration, but the main difference is transpiration comes from flora, or plants. Plants are living things too, and they require water to survive.
The main way plants get water is by sucking it from the ground with their roots, and transpiration is when the water gets removed from the plant and goes into the sky.
Next up we have condensation. Once you get to the high altitudes it gets pretty cold, and you’ve seen the mountains with snow on their tops I’m sure (or you can
quickly search it up). The water vapor gets less excited and the water molecules begin coming closer together and create clouds. We can spend a long time talking about
clouds but I’m sure <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/30/local-man-eats-clouds-taste-like-cotton-candy.html">Matthia Lucilla</a> can tell you a lot more.
After enough condensation a cloud gets too heavy and also pretty dark so it has to release its water. The water can come in various forms of your favorite states of
matter. You can get liquid rain, solid hail, or crystaline snow. Sometimes you even get thunder and lightning into the mix but thats a topic for another day. The
precipitation falls and guess where it ends up? In a collection of water! And thus the water cycle repeats itself.</p>

<p>So why is Verginia refusing to drink water? It’s all because the teacher exposed a fun fact, something he should not have done in the precense of the cautious
Verginia. “Did you know that we could be drinking the same water as the dinosaurs did?” said Verginia’s science teacher. And this is when Verginia began to doubt
everything she knew about the world. Eventually she calmed down and only began doubting water but the amount of doubt she had for water was still at an alarming
level. “If the dinosaurs drank it, who else has been involved with the water? And did I even mention the water travels through the digestive system and also gets
recycled through that? Gross! This water is way too sus to drink,” said Verginia during out interview.</p>

<p>The neighbors are constantly trying to push Verginia to start drinking water again but to no avail. For now they can only keep on trying. Verginia has survived so
far by first freezing her water to turn it into solid ice, then boiling it for a good amount of time (and collecting the vapor so nothing is wasted). Then she has
her own set of chemicals and filtration systems to ensure her water is purified to the maximum, she cannot trust anyone else with purifying water because you don’t
know where it could be.</p>

<p>I hope the SAR (Hecrenews Science and Research) approves of this article. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <description>An article about Court Mandate forces Sports team to change name to “Florida #$!$!@#$%#@-ers</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may have heard in a recent <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/09/hecrenews-to-take-legal-action-against-houston-hecretaries.md.html">Mjir article</a>, the HBA isn’t too happy with the renaming of a local sports team to the Houston, Texas HecreTaries. An HBA spokesperson recently called what they believe to be nothing more than an attention-grabbing publicity stunt an “attention-grabbing publicity stunt”. According to the spokesperson, “Legal action is promised. Our best men are working to right this horrible wrong”</p>

<p>And legal action was indeed taken. The HBA was very intent on taking the issue right to the courts, and so right to the courts they took the issue. The case was judged by a Mr. Nai Dorfsis-Ilian. The captain of the Houston, Texas HecreTaries, Joke Hoes was representing the defense (I suspect they blew all their budget paying handball fines to actually hire an actual lawyer), and a very special person headed the HBA’s veritable legal army.</p>

<p>As the designated court reporter (you can’t imagine the hours of Typing Trainer required to land that gig), I was shocked when Af Roman coolly walked into the room. Apparently he had finished that tour of his former empire, and deciding to reclaim it some other day, had gotten back into the professional intimidation business.</p>

<table>

    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/houston_texas_hecretaries_in_action.jpg" alt="" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><em>An image of the Houston, Texas HecreTaries soccer team in action. They’ve attracted much criticism for their violent play and constant handballing, but that’s their personal choice, I guess. Too bad 87.6% of their team gets red carded each game, on average.</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The case started out pretty lacklusterly, as most cases these days do. Just a bunch of people talking legal whatnot. But then the fireworks began. We all learned the HBA’s secret plan in bringing Af Roman. He was to cross-examine the Houston, Texas HecreTaries’ witnesses so intimidatorily that they would faint on the spot, or something like that.</p>

<p>The first witness of the HecreTaries was a professional typist that talked about how there was a difference between a capital letter and a lowercase error. While questioning this witness, the prosecution also brought up how <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/20/writing-in-all-caps-found-to-be-more-persuasive.html">Blat Beck</a> received different treatment when he held up the same sign in lowercase versus uppercase. After that, it was Af Roman’s turn. He began by asking the typist’s name, first, then last. Next came “when were you born?” Next came his mother’s maiden name, his social security number, and finally the location of a shoebox he buried that was filled with shimilac. Finally, Roman leaned in real close and said, “Foolboy, I know where you live. I know who you work for. I know everything about you. But I have one last question. Do <em>you</em> know who my uncle is?”</p>

<p>The typist, intimidated to the core, promptly leaped off of the witness stand and ran away screaming. Not the first time I just had to marvel at Af Roman’s intimidatory prowess. Truly an expert in his craft.</p>

<p>The second witness was Seth George, a local resident of Houston, Texas. Joke Hoes had called him to testify that Houston was indeed a real place. Hoes wished to argue that the Houston, Texas HecreTaries had a greater presence in Houston, Texas than the HBA (big mistake). Not only were the HecreTaries universally hated as a sports team, the HBA has many chapters in Houston.</p>

<p>When it came time to cross-examine, Af Roman walked up to George with nothing but a smile on his face. “What’s up, Mr. Double-first name?” Aside from that remark, the examination actually went quite normally. However, Mr. George was so terrified from the typist’s turn with Roman that he kept expecting something intimidatory to happen. The tension got to him, and just as Roman was about to walk back to his seat, Seth George broke. He said that Hoes paid him to state that he had heard of the Houston, Texas HecreTaries before, despite the fact that the team lived many hundreds of miles from Houston. Another point for the HBA!</p>

<p>After some deliberation, the judge ruled that the former Houston, Texas HecreTaries had to change their names to the Florida #$!$!@#$%#@-ers. Whether or not the team has to move to Florida was not discussed, so who knows. After the verdict was given, honorable judge Nai Dorfsis-Ilian hurried from the courthouse, without giving so much as a reason for the verdict.</p>

<p>Perhaps Dorfsis-Ilian was really hungry and just wanted to get the case over with. Maybe he was salty that the HecreTaries has surprisingly won their most recent soccer game against Santa Monica Squirm Masters, despite countless fouls and every player on the team getting disqualified for picking the ball up and running with it, except Joe Hoes. Hoes somehow managed to get the ball into the goal without picking it up, and the Squirm Masters were simply too beaten up to even kick the ball in the direction of the HecreTaries’ goal. Or maybe Af Roman’s intimidation powers rolled off on him a little too strongly. Who knows?</p>

<hr />

<p>Whew, I sure am taking my time with these articles. Hopefully another will be posted within the next year. Sometimes I really regret those <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/30/an-update-on-our-legal-troubles.html">procrastination lessons</a> from Shroops the Mighty. Well, Woops out. I’ll think of a fun ending gimmick later, although I’ve gotta say, Mister Mjir’s popping in and out is quite fire.</p>

    <title>Train Causes Traffic Delays</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/15/train-causes-traffic-delays.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/15/train-causes-traffic-delays.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Train Causes Traffic Delays</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trains go chug-a-chug-a-chug-a-chug-a-chug-a-choo-choo! Trains are an iconic symbol of human industrialization, the growth of human techonology and the ability to
better tap into and harness our imaginations. The early pioneers of trains spent back-breakign hours under the sweltering sun and dangerous conditions to lay down some
tracks, if only they were able to also drop some bars then we would have some fire ‘classical’ music. Trains can help with transportation, but one particular train
has achieved a milestone of ruining traffic all around.</p>

<p>“Was just driving in me car,” said a local man, whoops, I forgot to take his name. You’ll have to trust me on this interview. “See I was about to go forward, I bought
the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/09/man-invents-device-that-turns-traffic-light-from-red-to-green.html">magic device which turns the signal</a> and
I was just waiting for the connection to stabilize so that the signal would magically turn green. It finally turned green and I was ready and raring to go but the railroad crossing stopped me in my tracks! Guess I’ll have to get a refund.” The train stopped a couple of cars from passing but the traffic chaos did not stop there.</p>

<p>This train also blocked the traffic of 7 ships passing by. “How in the world did the train even start going on the water?” said the captain of one of the ships. The
train was just cruising along the water like it did in the Polar Express but on water instead of ice. Usually most people do not care about water traffic, but in the
recent years transporation by water has gotten increasingly popular and many people, upper class, middle class, and lower class have been riding on boats to experience
the joys and wonders of the seven seas (although scientists at our very own SAR say there are more than seven seas). This was already a wild ride but the passengers
of the train were so engrossed in their smartphones they did not notice what was happening now or what was happening next.</p>

<p>The train began flying. Not only was it going to stop the traffic on earth and water, it would also reach the air. Several planes had to stop midflight (they stayed in
suspension of course) because of the train. The plane passengers were really annoyed because they were really getting into that plane flow. Several helicopters also
had to stop because of the train flying. The train’s passengers did not notice anything but serveral plane passengers noticed. Some believed they were going crazy
and some updated their snapchat stories, one woman even got a streak of 17 years after that photo. Afterwards, the train continued back on the tracks and the passengers
safely and quickly reached their destination.</p>

<p>“This is my favourite train, always super fast and super reliable,” said one of the passengers. I was about to ask the conductor for an interview but he dipped as he
had to go to the next stop. Trains are truly magnificent, and maybe soon this train will interrupt fire traffic, then interrupting traffic of all four elements.
Until then, this has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Man Erects Wall to Deter Nut-Eating Rodents</title>

    <description>An article about Man Erects Wall to Deter Nut-Eating Rodents</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Slobodan Shohre has the average house but what’s special about Shohre’s residency is his backyards. While most people in a house won’t do much with their backyard,
Shohre really likes his backyard. He <em>really</em> likes it, a lot. He has many decorations including a fountain, gnomes, and many flora which the butteflies and bees sure
do like. Shohre also likes birds. In the past he’s been a bird watcher and even uncovered a group rumored to be time-traveling bird watchers from the 1900s but his
memory was erased after discovering them so he cannot remember the details. Shohre has a nice birdfeeder he uses and birds come throughout the day to eat from his
bird feeder. Blue jays, red robbins, spparows, and more. However, there is one major enemy Shohre faces in his backyard, the dreaded squirrel.</p>

<p>Most people don’t pay much attention to squirrels. “Oh, that’s a squirrel,” most would say. Squirrels are practically omnipresent, and have survived the transformation
of a lush, vibrant, natural Earth to an urban metroplex dominated by homo-sapiens. Recently, a
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/21/local-zoo-adds-homo-sapiens-to-exhibit.html">zoo added homo sapiens to its exhibit</a> and it might be worth checking
out that article for more information on it. Anywho, most people are neutral about squirrels. Some even like squirrels, until they climb trees and start chucking down
acrons on your head (and those things hurt, those cheeky little buggers). Backyard connoisseurs such as Shohre, however, believe squirrels are their number one enemy.
These creatures have great physical abilites. They are great climbers, can jump far distances, and are resilient. There is a certain gang of squirrels always hanging
out in Shohre’s backyard and they ruin everything.</p>

<p>The squirrels do not do much damage to Shohre’s physical properties, the fountains, statues, and gnomes, but they sure do a ton of damage to his plants and what
irritates Shohre the most is the squirrel’s disruption of the bird feeders. Shohre’s favourite birds are chilling at the feeder eating some nice food when a squirrel
comes along, trounces about the yard, climbs up to the bird feeder one way or another, scares all the birds away, and steals the food. To Shohre, squirrels are just
theives, but he cannot take legal action against them unfortunatelly, and of course we at the Hecrenews already have our hands full of legal issues. There are so many
you could write a 100-page essay about them, the people involved, and the intricacies and nuances about them. Anywho, Shohre’s community had open backyards, meaning
unfenced. Most people would not vibe with this but Shohre’s community knows the boundaries of their yards and as long as everyone can follow the community’s unwritten
social contract all is good, and some residents say it’s even better than living with fences. However, Shohre needed to do something revolutionary. For the first time
since his community’s inception he was going to build a fence. This was a radical move, as everyone in the community was happy with no fences and if one person builds
a fence that could spur others to build a fence and the social order and peace of the community could crumble in an instant.</p>

<p>Shohre knew the consequences. He spents long nights thinking about the aftermath of constructing a fence in his backyard. As his favourite big purple man said, “The
hardest choices will require the strongest wills or something like that” Shohre told us. A week had passed since Shohre got the idea, and tomorrow was the day of
action. After enough decision-making, he decided he needed to construct a fence, the squirrels were being too much of a problem. The next day a delivery van came
with a bunch of fences enough to cover the perimeter of Shohre’s backyard. His neighbors looked in shock as Shohre put up the walls. This was not only a physical
way of keeping squirrels out, but a symbolic way of locking himself from the rest of the community, he was now an outcast, he was not one with his community now.</p>

<p>After a week of waiting to see if his results were successful, they were not. The squirrels were easily able to hop over the fence like some Italian plumbers. Shohre
regretted his decision and immediately took the fence down, once again uniting with his community and he apologized for his actions. It seems the squirrels won
this battle with Shohre, but Shohre says the war is not over. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Local Earthing Blows Up Small One Man Spaceship With Colossal Destructive Space Station</title>

    <description>An article about Local Earthing Blows Up Small One Man Spaceship With Colossal Destructive Space Station</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yo. What is this? Banana the Human posting <em>two</em> articles in the span of 24 hours. Surely the World Is Turn’d Upside Down(heh, Yorktown reference).</p>

<p>Antarctican Peary Roberts is the pride of our planet today. He has achieved the impossible, proving to the galaxy once and for all that Earthlings are somewhat competent at things they do. His name will no doubt be remembered along with greats like Eif al-Tawa, Sheesh Kai Bob, and possibly me if I ever get that Pulitzer. I sat down with this fine gentleman to discuss his triumph.</p>

<p>Banana: Hello, Peary. For all the viewers, could you tell us what exactly you did</p>

<p>Peary: Yo, viewers. First of all, I would like to congratulate Banana on a Pulitzer, because he will definitely get one after interviewing me, of course. As for what I did, it’s really amazing. I managed to take down a E-Airfoil Fighter manned by just one person using the incredibly destructive Demise Cepheid Variable Station. T’was nothing, in fact. All I needed to do was fire the big green laser at the ship and send it to oblivion.</p>

<p>At this point, I would like to add some background information. What Peary achieved was so amazing because the opposite of what he had done was becoming quite commonplace. No doubt, for years you have heard the stories of small one man spaceships taking down a giant battle station, but for the first time, the Uno Reverse card has been applied on this feat.</p>

<p>Banana: What prompted you to take this action Peary? What inspired you?</p>

<p>Peary: Well, the short answer would be the fool who was piloting the E-Airfoil, Jocose Morose, was trying to do the age old hit and run on our battle station. So I decided to take him out[Hecrenews add on: Jocose Morose did not die during the explosion, he just got hit, sparks flew out of his ship, it exploded, and he teleported back to Earth.[ Also, no mice were harmed in the making of this article(this is so the Mouse House doesn’t sue us again)]. The long answer is those ruddy scumbags who own one man ships always like to flex on us middle-class bulk transport travelers. So I decided to flex right back at him, in the form of a giant green laser. As my father always used to say “No harm is done if it’s done by a laser”.</p>

<p>At this point, I was getting a bit uncomfortable, so I excused myself from the meeting. But as the head of the Department of Useless Violence, Phlaied All Aive, said “The achievement was a resounding success”.</p>

<p>Well, that’s it for this article. I know the quality is rubbish. But hey, this is what happens when I write daily articles. Banana Out.</p>

    <title>Breaking News: Hector just posted an Article!</title>

    <description>An article about Breaking News: Hector just posted an Article!</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We really, honestly didn’t think that the intern had it in him, but by golly, did Hector post an article about an hour ago. And this is like his 6th article or something! Oh, how productive he is! Just has so much energy (and is much less evil than the last new person to join us, Eif al-Tawa). Although he makes far too many references to that grandfather of his, the writing is solid, and the boss appreciates that. Well, I don’t think the boss appreciates anything in life anymore (he completely shot down the employee appreciation day idea), but it’s as close as it can be to the Bearded Boss valuing Hector.</p>

<p>Now, you readers may have been missing me and my altogether unique writing style. Oh, I could out-write the best of them. Too bad I didn’t post too frequently. And then I took a long break all of a sudden. Well, I strongly suspect that all of that will be elucidated up in the sequel to <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/13/the-tale-of-banana-the-human.html">BananaTheHuman’s most recent article</a>. I guess you’ll just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>In other news, there has been a growing movement within the hecrenews to protest the boss’s daily article regimen. Only one of our incredibly-mistreated troupe of article writers has even managed to keep this going, and we’re not sure of the effects its had on his mental health. Mister Mjir has been acting strange lately, but maybe that’s just how he always is. Mostly championed by Hector and I, we seek to try and lessen the requirement just a bit (and maybe increase our nonexistent pay while we’re at it!). Anywho, since only Mister Mjir has found it in himself to write daily articles, I think we have lots of support.</p>

<p>Anyways, I’ve also picked up the story on the legal action against the Houston, Texas HecreTaries. That, combined with the lobbying to designate the desert that <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/21/one-man-to-take-revenge-on-deserts-for-enormous-weight-gain.html">Blat Beck</a> is nearly finished digging up as a <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/29/hecretary-proponents-protest-de-desertification-of-historic-battle-site.html">historic landmark</a> means that I have quite a lot to cover on the legal side of things. Whoopee! Many more articles, coming your way.</p>

<hr />

<p>I see that Hector’s adapted my use of the  horizontal line and the other two have started saying “[author] out”. Guess I have to find myself a new gimmick, then. How else are you going to distinguish between all our articles? By reading the author name and picture posted at the top of each one? Pshhhhh</p>

    <title>Local Streaming Service Deletes ‘Cancel Subscription’ Button</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/14/local-streaming-service-deletes-cancel-subscription-button.html</link>

    <description>An article about Local Streaming Service Deletes ‘Cancel Subscription’ Button</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a daring yet ingenious move, local streaming service Nit Flex has decided to remove the ‘Cancel Subscription’ button from their interface. This daring move has single handedly brought Nit Flex out of their financial troubles, and Nit Flex’s CEO, Nithin Felix, is absolutely rolling in cash money right now.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview granted to the Hecrenews, Felix goes over how he was <del>forced</del>inspired to make this drastic change:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>”Well, you see, we were in a bit of a pickle a couple weeks ago. People were pulling out of their subscription plans left and right, something about ‘exorbitant monthly fees’ and ‘absolutely disgusting content I wouldn’t be paid to see’. Personally, I didn’t see what was wrong. We charged very good rates, for us at least. And our shows weren’t that bad. Especially that 7-season masterpiece of paint drying, it took forever to upload that.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Due to this really quite horrid state of economic affairs, the brains at Nit Flex (limited to the scant amount of brain cells whizzing about in Nithin Felix’s mind) decided that they had to do something drastic. Something dangerous. Something daring. Something… diasporic? (Idk, I ran out of D adjectives. So much for being the anagram god behind names such as <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/07/the-hunt-for-h-e-c-an-update-on-our-legal-troubles-pt-3.html">Shrewne and New Shere</a>.)</p>

<p>And so, in a brief moment of unconscious insight that mysteriously came to Felix while he was <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/23/billions-report-losing-consciousness-for-unknown-period-of-time-last-night.html">unconscious</a> some nights prior, he decided to completely take out the concept of canceling your subscription. What a great idea!</p>

<p>The removal of the button has been a huge economic success for Felix and Nit Flex in general. In just the first two days since implementing the change, Nit Flex reported an astounding 27,000% increase in profit. Quite a jump! In addition to the removal of the ability to subscribe, Felix has doubled down and increased the subscription price by a couple thousand dollars per week. Some may call it the move of a madman, but Nithin Felix’s revenue stream says otherwise.</p>

<p>While this may have been a truly masterful decision on the part of Nit Flex, let’s look at the other perspective as well. What about all of the subscribers that suddenly found themselves without a ‘Cancel Subscription’ button? Here are some of the youngest subscribers’ inputs, carefully gathered and presented to the hecrenews by Nit Flex’s Human Outreach and Surveying Them Association (minus Geriatric Elders) (HOSTAGE, for short):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Alright, alright. Fine, I’ll say it, just stop the pain! Nit Flex’s decision to cancel the ‘Cancel Subscription’ button is the best thing that’s ever happened to me.” - Bourd Gourd</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m a fellow CEO! You can’t do this to me! If only I had that device that automatically turns metal to rust, I could break free from these chains” - <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/09/man-invents-device-that-turns-traffic-light-from-red-to-green.html">Hooshar Manus</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I really really like having no ability to stop the constant flow of cash that goes from my pocket to Nit Flex’s” - Essey Eighty (nicknamed <em>**</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Taking-out-that-button-is-the-best-thing-ever. Can I go see my family now?” - Ibn Ribbn</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I swear, I’m going to speak to all of your managers! You can’t torture me and keep you job, of course you can’t” - Kaker Neran</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, practically everybody surveyed was immensely satisfied with the decision. What luck! For a second there, I thought it might be unpopular, but I guess people are completely fine with large sums of money being extracted from them without consent.</p>

<p>Other CEO’s are heavily considering “pulling a Nit Flex”, as it’s being called nowadays. It’s been proven to lead to extreme commercial success, after all. While it remains to be seen how many other streaming services will follow Felix’s example, you can rest assured that you won’t be able to stop giving Nit Flex millions of dollars a month anytime soon.</p>

<p>In related news, a team of hacky-types is trying to somehow resuscitate this lost ‘Cancel Subscription’ button in a last-ditch attempt to keep their bank accounts from dipping sharply in the negatives.</p>

<hr />

<p>Wow, another article, all done! I think I really am getting the hang of this hecrenews thing. To conclude, I leave you with the wise words of my father’s father: “rat-a</p>

    <description>An article about Man uses Apples to Ward Off Doctors</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Úlfur Svetlana had to go to something he annually dreaded, the Doctor’s Appointment. All throughout his life he has been told the doctors are just normal people
vibing and fixing you up (although they cannot fix your emotions if you are a teen pretending to be depressed). Svetlana had an innate fear of doctors. The same way
people were afraid of bugs, spiders, clowns, Svetlana was afraid of doctors. Instead of recieving the emotional support from people around him, he was ridiculed for
being scared of the doctor. Every family member, friend, and even bystanders and strangers would start roasting him for cowering in fear when he had to visit the
doctor. Dentist was no problem, eye doctor all good, it was just the standard doctor giving him problems.</p>

<p>Svetlana was once again cowering in fear in his closet. Soon his family would have to drag him out of there as they go for a combined check-up, and Svetlana had no
choice but to go, no matter how strong his phobia was. For Svetlana, going to the doctor was like getting a shot from the doctor. Speaking of which, the injections
were another subject Svetlana feared a lot. He wasn’t a skrub and knew the vaccines would (and have) saved his life a numerous amount of times but the thought of a
needle poking into his skin and then a foreign substance entering his body did more than simply send shivers down his spine. However, for this particular visist,
Svetlana had brought with him a secret weapon. For a couple of years he started delving into botany. Not only did Svetlana have a successful vegetable garden (which
he then taught local schools how to make), but he also had a fruit garden. There was one fruit in particular Svetlana was cultivating, and this fruit would serve as
his ultimate counter against his fated enemy. You guessed it (I hope you did), Svetlana was growing apples.</p>

<p>As the addage goes, “An apple a day keeps the doctor away.” Doctors may be Svetlana’s greatest fear, but he knows the counter. Doctors, for some strange reason
(Science and the Hecrenews Science and Research (SAR) are unable to figure out) doctors cannot stand apples. And not meaning they will sit down in the precense of an
apple, doctors will run for their lives if they notice an apple in the near vicinity. SAR encourages individuals, especially young and learning kids, to test out the
experiment for themselves. While my article quality is not good enough to have images like
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/20/writing-in-all-caps-found-to-be-more-persuasive.html">Wopp’s great example</a>, SAR has provided the instruction to
run the experiment and it’s not that hard. Use one day as a control. Do not bring anything sus, meaning any type of food, to the doctor, and see what happens. Then
switch up the type of food you bring. This is called an independent variable, it is what the experimenter can change and is what the dependent variable (which is the
doctor’s reaction) relies on. After getting your control and recording your observations, try bringing in a vegetable and then a fruit other than an apple. Finally,
bring an apple and see what happens. For extra flavor, try bringing in a tomato, which experts cannot determine if it’s a fruit or a vegetable, and see what happens.
That’s all from the SAR today.</p>

<p>Anywho, Svetlana went into the room waiting for the doctor to come. The doctor soon came in, asking “How are you today” and had an assortment of needles and syringes
and other scary stuff with him. Svetlana was going crazy on the inside due to his fear, but on the outside (the real world) he calmly took the apple out of his pocket.
The doctor wasn’t looking at the apple at first but once he saw the apple, he immediately broke into a cold sweat. The doctor’s breathing changed, becoming heavier
and faster. Goosebumps rose all over. The doctor tried to run but fainted before reaching the door and the doctor had to be sent to the hospital. Svetlana survived
the doctor visit this time, but will he be so lucky the next? He sure is getting it from his family. Anywho, this has been Mister Mjir popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>The Tale Of Banana The Human/What I Was Doing While I Was Gone</title>

    <description>An article about The Tale Of Banana The Human/What I Was Doing While I Was Gone</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What’s up peeps. I know, I know, I said I might post a bit more, but hey, I’m lazy. But I’m going to tell you where I was during my prolonged absence(before my drivers article). And no, I was not playing on the HBA twitch stream the whole time. Let’s get to it.</p>

<p>Also, before I get to it(even though I said that I would right before this), I would like to thank our official sponsor, Anti-Snaxe Spray(100% more effective than Snaxe Spray). Pick up a bottle at your local HBA headquarters. The reason for needing it will be apparent soon.</p>

<p>Let’s try out some 3rd person, shall we?</p>

<p>Things hadn’t been the same since Florida. Sure, the office was still running as well as it normally did, but Banana had noticed that something was off. Wopps had been disappearing from his desk at random intervals, Mr Mjir was blatantly avoiding the water fountain, and the boss hadn’t personally shown up in the office for a week.</p>

<p>Banana was fed up with these abnormalities. He cornered Wopps at the copier machine, threateningly holding his coffee cup to Wopps’ face.</p>

<p>“What’s going on Wopps? Why hasn’t the boss shown up? And since when has Mjir developed a fear of lead-contaminated water?”</p>

<p>Wopps tried to look calm, but he fidgeted with his hands. “Look Banana, I don’t know much. All I know is <em>they</em> are back.”</p>

<p>Banana looked at Wopps suspiciously. “You sure?”</p>

<p>“Positive”</p>

<p>Banana’s face was deep with contemplation. He didn’t know whether to hunt <em>them</em> or not. Last time they appeared, he(along with Wopps and Mr Mjir), had lost a good friend. His heart didn’t have the strength to lose any more.</p>

<p>“Okay Wopps. Thanks for letting me know.”</p>

<p><em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em></p>

<p>As he started to leave the office for the day, Banana couldn’t help but feel guilt. He looked back at his friends, Wopps casually dangling a non-vegetarian substance over the sleeping Mjir’s open mouth, waiting for him to wake up and freak. Banana smiled. He would miss them, but they could handle him being gone.</p>

<p>The day was rainy, and much too cold. Banana took out his umbrella, and with a grim expression on his face, he set off to the bar(Don’t freak out guys, Banana the Human’s not a drinker. It was also just a bar for fruit smoothies. This is Banana we are talking about).</p>

<p>It was as lively as it always had been. Dube was at the counter, shimmying up the glasses, humming to the pop beats blaring from the speaker behind. He waved at Banana, a grin lighting up his face. Banana smiled back, but memories of Dube memory wipe after his encounter with the Roller surfaced in his mind. He pushed them away, trying to focus on the task at hand. He grabbed a seat and the counter, and started to talk to Dube.</p>

<p>“Dube, I need some information. Apparently <em>they</em> are back.”</p>

<p>Dube’s eyes widened, and he stopped whatever he was doing at once.</p>

<p>“I had heard rumours, Banana, but I was hoping for them to be false. I can tell you what I’ve heard, but it’s up to you to do something about it. I’m out. I can’t go through that again, not after what happened to Veg…” Dube broke off, his eyes showing his pain. Banana looked at him sympathetically.</p>

<p>“It’s okay, Dube. You don’t have to come. And I promise, we will get Veg, the One who Tunnels, the Chief, all of our friends back, even if it requires going to the ends of the Hecresphere and back. But now, I need you to tell me what you know.”</p>

<p>Dube mustled himself up. “Look, I heard about some stirring in Egypt. Abu Simbel, to be specific. Something about the 3rd Ramesses statue. And there was a warning I picked up. Don’t trigger the Purple Haze. I have know idea what that means Banana, but I wish you good luck. The last flight leaves at 8:30 PM. You best hurry.”</p>

<p>Banana thanked Dube, and after taking one last look at the Aznee Land Central Bar, he hurried to the airport.</p>

<p><em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em></p>

<p>The flight had been uneventful, if not borderline boring. The channels on the TV were all news, but none matched up to the brilliance of Hecrenews, so Banana decided to avoid them. He settled on taking a long nap.</p>

<p>As he got off at Aswan, he was greeted by a blast of hot air, and the smoldering sun. <em>Welcome to the desert</em>, Banana thought to himself. But Banana smiled, remembering his roots in the Deserts of Mangifera. Then his thoughts drew to his banishment, his exile from his homeworld. How the Yak Cats found him, raised him as one of their own.</p>

<p>“Are you Banana?,” a man’s voice called out.</p>

<p>Banana directed his attention to the source of the voice, and found his taxi driver. He was a friendly chap by the name of Robin, and as they drove towards Abu Simbel, he delighted Banana with his stories of his time as a sailor. Once they reached Abu Simbel, Banana paid the man, gave his number to Robin, and said goodbye to his new friend.</p>

<p>He headed towards the Rameses statues, wondering which one was the third one. As he approached them, he noticed one with a faint purple haze around it. <em>That’s gotta be it. Now what was that about the haze Dube had said. Ah, yes avoid it.</em> But, Banana being Banana, went right up to the statue, pushed through the purple haze, and touched the smooth sandstone.</p>

<p>He suddenly heard faint, hissing noises, growing louder every second. He turned around, his back to the statue, and found himself being watched by four creatures. They had short, stubby legs, trunks as wide as a cedar tree, and elongated serpentine bodies. But what really surprised him was their faces. They had the face of a cat.</p>

<p>Banana staggered back into the statue, shocked. He knew that they were back, but he had forgotten how the beasts sent waves of fear through the body.And these looked different, more ancient than the generic snake with a cat face that he had encountered. For the first time, the idea of multiple Snaxii species entered his mind.</p>

<p><em>Think Banana. Where have you seen these things before</em>. Banana vaguely remembered the Egyptian exhibit at the MOMA, and paintings of snakes with feet and cat faces. <em>Serpopards. These are Serpopards</em>. And as he realized what they were, the 4 ancient Egyptian snaxii opened their maws and darted at him.</p>

<p>End of Part 1</p>

<p>Ha. You guys thought you were going to get more, right. Well, Banana the Human, as I said before, is extremely lazy. But maybe the second part will come out in a week or so. Or not. For now, Banana out(I know Wopps says Wopps out, but hey, a little copyright infringement is good for friendships).</p>

    <title>Expert Seachers Find Phone Lost on Silent</title>

    <description>An article about Expert Seachers Find Phone Lost on Silent</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sung-Min Saško had recently lost his phone. His contact with the outside world beyond his corporation. The situation got so intense his boss had to call the Phone Search
and Rescue Squad (PS) in to help Saško find the phone. If you missed out on part one check it out
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/10/phone-on-silent-lost-searchers-cannot-find.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The PS were quite stumpted for quite a while as they were unable to get a lead. They had all the experts who knew plenty on phone runaway cases, the detective task
force was still looking for clues. Meanwhile the Phone Behaviorial Division was busy reading the grand extbooks all about the behaviors of phones. The office was about
to close down and it was the end of the day and the PS stil hadn’t found any clues, but as soon as Saško was about to leave his cubicle they found a lead. Tiny
phoneprints revealing the path the phone had travelled. It had seemed the phone had used the elevator to escape and then ran outside the building to who knows where.
Some of the PS Detective Task Force immediately contact the Phone Behaviorial Divison and the rest continued to analyze the phone prints to figure out where the phone
met. The rest of the PS members there quickly set up a base of operation at Saško’s cubicle. Poor Saško, he’s going to have to clean it up when he’s all done. There
was a pretty large map of the town layed out on the desk and everyone was holding markers marking where the phone had ran and where it could have gone. Although the
office would have usually gotten quiet as the last members left and the office was closed for the day, today the office was more busy than ever as multiple PS members
were busy phoning other people and answering other people. The PS eventually narrowed down a couple of palces the phone could be in. But then there was a problem.</p>

<p>See there were 5 possible places the phone could be in but there were only enough people to send out three squads. The PS decided it would be best to just guess
and send two squads and leave one squad on standby. After about 10 min. the squads were able to reply back to headquarters and found no trace of the phone there. Saško
was becoming more and more anxious. He could’ve just bought a new phone but now this had become a big deal. His boss who had offered a lending hand may have accidently
added salt to the wound (ouch). Everyone was in a blight mood but then a phone call came from a person not in the PS. It was an Old Lady who saw the phone running across
town the other day. After asking a few more questions on the phone the PS was able to locate the position of the phone, but there was a big proble. The phone was at
a valley between mountains about to cross the borders. Saško couldn’t believe it, it was becoming the scene of an action movie. The PS quickly sent the standby squad
there and they took off on high tech motorcycles. The other squads would be arriving via land and via helicopter. The phone was quickly approaching the boder and would
soon cross it, the PS had only 5 min.</p>

<p>After three minues the PS found the phone, and it was running fast. The PS launched multiple nets to catch the phone but the phone swiftly weaved it’s way in and out
of the traps. Things were getting dire because there were 30 seconds left before the phone would cross the border. This is when something unexpected occured. Saško,
in the flesh, jumped from the helicopter which the first squad was in (it had just arrived) and landed in front of his phone. The only thing stopping the phone from
reaching the border was its owner, Saško himself. The phone just took a long look at Saško and tried to run but Saško just started talking. Saško talked of the good
memories he had with the phone and how the phone has helped him out so much, far more than his friends in real life (although he is suspected to not have any of
those). We don’t know the full details of the speech but the phone was in tears and regretted trying to leave Saško. For the first time in history the PS’s client
retrieved their own phone (ignoring the transportation of course). Saško lived happily ever after. Not really, his girlfriend was livid he had not picked up the
phone and there were a wopping 1468 missed calls! Yikes! The second squad of the PS was also a little upset they weren’t there at the scene of the action, they wanted
to see a guy jump out of a helicopter because it would have been like an action movie in real life.</p>

<p>Remember, if your phone ever runs away call the PS. Not only do they find phones but they can find practically everything. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and
popping out.</p>

    <title>Man Brings Chair to Go-Kart Race, Wins</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/11/man-brings-chair-to-go-kart-race-wins.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/11/man-brings-chair-to-go-kart-race-wins.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Man Brings Chair to Go-Kart Race, Wins</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A local go-kart competition was placed and many people were interested in participating. Many participants were go kart experts, able to build, customize, and upgrade
their go karts to the highest level of expertise. One man, however, breaks the trend and sets a new precedent which will change the world of go kart racing forever.</p>

<p>Octavianus Ianus knew he was going to participate in the race the moment he saw the flyer. It was a bright poster posted on the bulletin boards across town with some
very nice Comic Sans MS font, which added to the appeal. Ianus dreamt of winning such a race since he was a wee little boy but he never won. In elementary school he
had few friends for he was not the fastest runner in the grade. But Ianus was determined and tried other avenues of racing. When Ianus found racing with vehicles, he
knew that was what he wanted to do. It felt natural to him to ride in a multitude of various vehicles ranging from bicycles to trucks to planes. Howver Ianus faced
one major problem: the participants would not be supplied with a vehicle. This was a drastic shift from what he was used to as usually his team/sponsor would provide
him with the vehicle.</p>

<p>Ianus asked around to see what was possible. He knew a few car mechanics and he soon began a crash course in learning how a car works internally. By the time he was
done he was good enough to become a car mechanic as a living, but he realized he was participating in a go-kart race, not a car race. He asked his mechanic homies
about
it and they said “It’s basically the same.” Ianus still needed some more inspiration, so he dug up an old book and found a link to an ancient website, YouTube. On
YouTube there were many videos Ianus could watch and he saw a video of some guy building his own custom go-kart with a few easy, simple steps. Ianus not had the
inspiration he needed, but there was another hurdle he faced.</p>

<p>To construct the go-kart, Ianus would need to shell out the big bucks to buy parts. Unfortunately for Ianus, he was lacking in the big bucks department and was 100%
unable to afford any of the kart parts save a few tools and some nuts and bolts. Time was running out, as it was a week before the competition. Ianus was becoming
desparate and spent most of the week frantically thinking about how he would participate in the race. He couldn’t run because he was slow and would look silly, and he
couldn’t use his car because then he would become disqualified. On the night before the race, an idea struck Ianus’ mind: he could bring a chair to the race. While
he couldn’t bring his office’s fancy chair with an adjustable height and rolling wheels, he could upgrade his own chair at his home to have wheels. After spending an
all-nighter preparing his vehicle, Ianus was ready for the competition.</p>

<p>The competition was a bright sunny day, the sky was a nice blue and the birds were chirping, and Ianus was ready to win. If he wasn’t in the mindset of winning, then
there was no way he would be able to pull off the dub. The other participants, numbering about 20 more, were confused and Ianus and some were laughing him off as a
joke. The racers set up at the starting line and waiting for the flag waver to give them the signal to go. Once they got that signal, Ianus took off at godspeed. The
karts needed some time to convert the fuel into movement, but Ianus just blasted away instantly. One might assume the go-karts have a higher speed, but Ianus
completely dominated them, not allowing a single person to get within a meter’s range. The audience was in utter shock and Ianus took home the solid gold. Ianus was
pretty happy but declined further interview as he needed to make up work hours.</p>

<p>Well this was a pretty strange article. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Phone on Silent Lost, Expert Searchers Cannot Find it</title>

    <description>An article about Phone on Silent Lost, Expert Searchers Cannot Find it</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sung-Min Saško was at a meeting for work on day and decided to turn his phone on silent, or do not disturb. While we do not understand the specifics of what the
 mode is actually called, we do know that it prevented the phone from vibrating or making any kind of sound. Saško made a lot of strong points during the meeting
 and his co-wokers say he carried the meeting and is soon going to carry the company. “He’s gonna become a big man and perhaps a big boss too while he’s at it” says
 Raja Bharat, a member of the sales team. However, Saško made one vital mistake. Saško lost his phone, and now there was no way to find it.</p>

<p>Saško did not realize he had lost his phone until he reached home. When he finally came home he wanted to chat with his girlfriend and that’s when he realized his
 phone was not in the correct pocket. Saško searched through his pockets, his bags, his drawers, his cabinets, between the sofa cushions, on the floor, anywhere a
 phone could be but he could not find it. Saško assumed he had just left it at his office so he went to sleep feeling a little bit more relaxed, knowing his phone was
 in a safe place. He could not call it because it was on silent and the GPS tracking would not work because his phone did not come pre-packaged with GPS, he had to
 install it himself but he was too lazy to do so and did not install the quintessential amenity.</p>

<p>When Saško returned to work next day he checked his cubicle. It wasn’t a big place but after rummaging through all his drawers for about 10 min. he was unable to find
 it. He asked his boss if he had left his phone at the meeting but his boss did not see anything. Saško was starting to become more anxious. He had suffered the same fate as a certain <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/06/woman-without-phone-unable-to-call-anyone.html">Elisaveta Eógan</a> did two months prior. He did not know where his phone was now and he was probably having a bunch of missed calls from his girlfriend, 100% not a good thing for Saško, he was going to get it when she finally returned from her overseas work. The boss decided to offer a helping hand to Saško and called over law enforcement to devise a search and rescue opeartion for the phone. Saško thought that this was too much but the boss assured him this was proper, it had happened once before when he too was a corporate slave not living the high life.</p>

<p>The Phone Search and Rescue Squad (PS) arrived shortly onto the scene and began questioning the boss and then Saško. Soon they began question the other employees at
 Saško’s company and no one was suspected of lying and no one noticed anyting about the phone. The PS said there were two possibilites: a simple phone theif (which was
 pretty rare these days) or the phone was in it’s rebellious phase and ran away (much more common and is dealt with a lot by the PS). The PS asked for photos of the
 phone but unfortunately those photos were in the phone which ran away, Saško did not havae any on hand but at least he knew the model and make of his phone, so the PS
 could know what it looks like.</p>

<p>The PS began hanging missing posters all around the local town but have not recieved any notice of it. They are still performing an official professional search and
 rescue operation but they are still looking for a lead. The PS is a welcoming organization willing to help anyone with their search and rescue needs. Anything from
 missing phones to missing nerf darts to tv remotes, these guys got you covered. I guess we will hear more from there later, this was Mister Mjir, poping in and now
 popping out.</p>

    <title>Hecrenews to take Legal Action against Houston, Texas HecreTaries</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/09/hecrenews-to-take-legal-action-against-houston-hecretaries.md.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/09/hecrenews-to-take-legal-action-against-houston-hecretaries.md.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Hecrenews to take Legal Action against Houston, Texas HecreTaries</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago a <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/24/local-sports-team-loses-faith-in-humanity-after-name-selection-competition.html">coach lost all hope in humanity due to a name selection competition</a>. The HBA was busy with other
pressing issues but they finally got a chance to look at the article and they are not happy. While the HBA loves the appreciation, dedication, and following of them
or the Hecretary Bird, a sports team naming themselves after the Hecretary Birds has caught their radar.</p>

<p>First a distinction should be revealed. There are Hecretary Birds, the good guys who must fight and defeat the evil Snaxii. There are also other creatures but we
will get to those at an other time, feel free the check out the Hecrepedia at your latest convienence (stay here a while…), hold up, the Hecrepedia isn’t updated to
show the other creatures, nevermind. Anywho, out of the Hecretary Birds there are the Airplane Pigeons, the Lesser Zecretary Bird, and The Hecretary Bird, notice the
capital <em>The</em> in the name. The Hecretary Bird is a Hecretary Bird, but a Hecretary Bird is not necessarily The Hecretary Bird, it’s as simple as 1, 2, 3.</p>

<p>So why is it such a big deal? Well you see, the HBA has to keep up their reputation and the reputation of the Hecretary Bird. The HBA loves people talking about the
greatness of the Hecretary Bird and also loves people talking about roasting some snaxii, but the Houston, Texas HecreTaries are not a sports team run by the HBA. The
HBA currently does not have a sports team, but if a team is so incompetent that it cannot enough decide its own team name then it is not worthy of naming itself after
The Hecretary Birds, although the love is still what the HBA wants. Apparently the legal issues are a little bit more complicated than that but it seems the simplest
way to sum it up is the HBA does not deem the Houston, Texas HecreTaries worthy enough to represent such a big ting.</p>

<p>Ideally, the HBA would be the ones resolving this issue, but they’ve seen us perform on the legal issue saga and now can fully trust us in legal issues (more work for
us, if only the boss could provide us with some better pay). It seems we are gonna have to settle the naming issue in court. It truly is sad, as long as the Texas
HecreTaries added an ‘Unofficial’ to their name they would have been good to go. Instead we are going to try and have them change their name to the
Florida #$!$!@#$%#@-ers. I don’t know about you but personally Florida #$!$!@#$%#@-ers rolls of the tongue really nicely and crisply. Who knows if we are going to see
the legendary likes of Af Roman again, that first court meeting was already a once in a lifetime opportunity and those intimidation tactics were god-tier, possibly
good enough to make him an Other Creature on the Hecrepedia and that is no easy feat.</p>

<p>Looking at the stats the Houston HecreTaries has been on a solid losing streak since their inception, sometimes losing by default, having many fouls, and a substantive
amount of red flags. Interestingly though, many spectators say that the team would be great at American football, but the team insists on playing football, or
American soccer. This is probably why they got on the HBA’s radar and why they’re a little upset.</p>

<p>Be sure to check out and follow the HBA’s <a href="https://twitter.com/hecretary">twitter</a>, which they have been running for a while. Great stuff right there. Anywho, this
has been Mister Mjir, popping in and popping out.</p>

    <title>Man Invents Device that turns Traffic Light from Red to Green</title>

    <description>An article about Man Invents Device that turns Traffic Light from Red to Green</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Post-doctoral student Hooshar Manus has devised a quite ingenious device. In his groundbreaking paper, he details a patent-pending invention that, quite frankly, has the power to change life as we know it. The unique piece of technology can, almost miraculously, make traffic lights go from red to green. One instant you’re waiting in line, and the next instant you can zoom! How awesome is that?</p>

<p>Hooshar hopes to rake in millions of shimilac with his new invention, and is currently selling devices for a steep, steep price of $5,000.00 + tax. But who knows? It may yet be worth it, to control the very fabric of time as you make all the red lights turn green. Just push a single button, and after a minute or two the horrid red light turns green, almost by magic.</p>

<p>There is a lengthy disclaimer included with the device when it ships, which basically amounts to saying that you should only use this to turn traffic lights from red to green, and it may take up to a minute or two to charge and switch the light effectively. This momentary waiting time is only a small price to pay for being able to zoom past all the green lights you can!</p>

<p>The hecrenews didn’t have the budget to buy one of these miraculous devices (because <em>someone</em> spent it all adding rocket engines to a battle cruiser), but reporters were able to interview some of the privileged few who purchased such a device. Here are some of their responses:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Quite the time-saver. I was in a traffic jam, about to get late for work. Then I remembered that little device I paid quite a bit for. I pressed the button, and the light just turned green! Amazing” - Mrs. Scintilla Rooney</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sometimes the device has a bit of lag associated with it, but waiting maybe 20-30 seconds is more than a fair price for making the light change from red to green” - Jeremiah Mamma-mia</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bruh this thing doesn’t even do anything, why are you interviewing people about it?” - Hoodie Guy</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“10/10. Great concept, great execution. Couldn’t have done it better myself.” - Johnston Thompson</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Skrraaa. Look ma, I’m on the news!” - Johnson Thomson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With these mostly-positive reviews, Hooshar Manus has already announced plans to make new iterations of the devices that, in addition to turning traffic lights from red to green, will turn them from green to yellow and from yellow to red as well. Such innovation! Manus plans to unveil a whole line of these devices and to branch out from traffic lights in the future. He’s planned tools to defrost frozen foods, buttons to make it day from night, and even an implement that will make somebody really, really want to use the restroom. Manus is putting a team together to try and combat some of the latency that is plaguing these products, but even waiting 12 hours is a fine price to pay, as long as you can control the very cycle of day and night.</p>

<p>The sea of opportunity that this great device will create will surely be vast. Having the power to control traffic lights at will? Sign me up!</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, that’s it for now. Hooshar Manus will definitely go down in history as the inventor of something truly great. But now, it’s time for me to tell you one of my gramps’s most famous sayings: “rat-a-ta</p>

    <title>Gamer Games to Heat up Homes during Winter</title>

    <description>An article about Gamer Games to Heat up Homes during Winter</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sten Gabriel lives in a cold place. Not as cold as Antartica but the summers are like the winters they teach in school and winters are ferocious. Gabriel is not even
an adult, but he has created great change in community. A handful of people die every year due to the very cold winters of where Gabriel is from and Gabriel wanted to
stop that. Although only a teen, he had a special skill which adults just couldn’t do as well as him. Gabriel was an up and coming pro gamer.</p>

<p>People across the nation treat gaming as a second, most of the times even lower than that, citizen. The media says gaming causes violence, most people say it’s a waste
of time, and most of the time gaming falls on the politcally incorrect side of the spectrum. However, studies have proven violence to be the major cause of violence,
not gaming: a violent person is more likely to do violent things and play violent games, the game itself is not a major factor in causing one to be noticably more
violent than they were. In addition, many people spend all their lives honing a game or sport, but these people get more respect as they have to train their bodies
and have physical strength to show for their passion. Gaming just doesn’t have noticable ‘real-world’ benefits. Some kids were able to do things like protect their
siblings from wild animals or drive a car to safety when the driver passes out and credit those to video games, but the media always shift attention to the next big
issue (of course we at the Hecrenews cover all that’s important in the Hecresphere).</p>

<p>Gabriel discovered something. It was not revolutionary, and in fact many people face the problem but just do not give it that much importance. When doing intense
gaming, Gabriel’s computer begins to heaten up. The internals of the computer are so hot it would be able to cook an egg and easily give a person a burn. Then Gabriel
connected the dots. People in his community were dying due to the intense winter, and Gabriel’s hobby can mitigate this problem or counteract it. Gabriel began going
to work. His school was closed due to the huge blizzard at the time so Gabriel had to research on his own. He had multiple textbooks and plenty of articles to help
him. After reading a bit in chemistry and physics, Gabriel began learning about electrons and after reading some articles he learned the conduction and flow of
electrons.</p>

<p>Now after gathering some materials, Gabriel was able to hook up his computer to a heater, and now was able to see the results of his experiment. Gabriel played some
heavy, high-power usage games on his computer and after a few minutes the temperature in his house increase by a wopping 10 degrees (not minor though)! Gabriel shared
his experiment with the others in his community, and soon all the children began hooking up their computers to their central heating unit and in the recent years,
not a single person has died in Gabriel’s community due to the cold weather. He became a hero in his community and we are here to document his story.</p>

<p>While the common person reading this article may believe it’s impossible to reach the levels of stoicism as Gabriel, he just followed a few simple steps. He identified
a problem, observed, researched, and implemented a solution. However, for most people there are a few more steps involved: make errors and repeat. Sometimes a solution
will not work the first time, that is a mistake. One must then identify what went wrong during that experiment and make adjustments to correct that mistake. But
with perseverance, anyone is able to solve any problem they encounter and make their world a better place to live in.</p>

<p>Also we are continuing to make a lot of spicy updates to the Hecrenews, we just added more features for our author sections, check it out if you get time, and more
updates are coming. We are gonna release our roadmap sometime in the future so you can see how Hecrenews is getting updated.This was Mister Mjir, popping in and now
popping out.</p>

    <title>Man Falls Ill, Experts Say Could have been Prevented by Wearing Helmet</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/08/man-falls-ill-experts-say-could-have-been-prevented-by-wearing-helmet.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/08/man-falls-ill-experts-say-could-have-been-prevented-by-wearing-helmet.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Man Falls Ill, Experts Say Could have been Prevented by Wearing Helmet</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent news, local resident Wimbe Wampa has recently taken ill. He was allegedly enjoying his 26th ice cream cup in an all-you-can-eat promotion of local eatery “Stuff Yer Gob”, when he suddenly felt faint. After a good night’s sleep, it was confirmed (by multiple insider sources) that Wampa had the sniffles.</p>

<p>Now, there’s no need for alarm. After reviewing the facts of the case, experts have decided not to call a public health emergency, because Wimbe Wampa’s sniffles are not, in fact, highly contagious. However, these experts also frown upon Wampa’s apparent disregard for his personal safety, as demonstrated by his not wearing a helmet of any kind. This was a major cause of his sickness, obviously.</p>

<p>Wearing a helmet is crucial to your survival in every possible way. When asked about the reason behind this, hecrenews’s Sheeple Dunnell (one of the aforementioned experts) said: “Because e = mc^2 and Newton weighed more than Bohr”.</p>

<p>For decades, the public has refused to wear bike helmets, and as a result, all manner of injuries, physical, mental, and even dental, have happened in quite horrifying numbers. Even the hecrenews’s own chief sciency-man, Sheeple Dunnell recently had a bad bout of diarrhoea brought on by an expired milkshake. If only poor old Sheeple had been wearing a helmet!</p>

<p>So take the pledge. <del>Eliminate the veg.</del> Pledge to wear a bike helmet, even if you think you’re the “cool” guy that don’t need no helmet. It really can save you. From illness, from hunger, from anything. Truly, the man that proudly flaunts his helmet is invincible. Try it today! To ensure that you don’t follow Wampa’s misdeed, make sure to always wear a bike helmet. Who knows, it could save your life!</p>

<hr />

<p>Apparently this daily article thing is hard. I can literally see the quality going down the drain. Just look at <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/07/the-hunt-for-h-e-c-an-update-on-our-legal-troubles-pt-3.html">the last article I wrote</a>. Actual gold dyude. Anyways,</p>

    <title>Bells across the World say Dumbells are Demeaning</title>

    <description>An article about Bells across the World say Dumbells are Demeaning</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In these times there are many groups pushing for more justice and better equality. Some of these movements have led to nationwide protests as the people want their
government to take action. It is in the goal of creating a progressive society, one which keeps on improving itself one step at a time. However, there is one group
seeking major attention, and those are bells.</p>

<p>For one bells do not even get that much recognition. When was the last time you heard, saw, or even thought of the word bell? Chances are it could be a day ago, a
week ago, a month ago, even a year! This is discrimination against bells but bells have kept silent for so many years, not once did they complain, humans are always
thinking about other humans but nobody gives any love or care to bells. However, the bells are not immediately demanding their equal rights, now the bells want
to fight against a stigma which has existed for many generations and many families. Bells across the the world are saying dumbells are demaning.</p>

<p>“How would you feel if someone called you dumb,” says a local bell we interviewd, “you would get mad, and you would get mad mad fast. You can think it’s just a word,
but that’s when you’re not on the recieving end. And how would you feel if someone called you dumb every day? That is past the point of making someone angry, that is
straight up bullying. There is a power imbalance because one side is calling the other dumb, and the other side is unable to do anything as they will just get laughed
off. In fact, most people show 0% support in this. They approve of dictionaries calling our relatives dumb. This is terrible. These bells do so much for society.
Humans would struggle to build those chad muscles if it weren’t for those bells. I have a friend myself who is labeled a dumbell, he has led so many people to great
body success by making their arms magnitudes stronger than they used to be, why does everyone call him dumb?”</p>

<p>The local bell expresses the main points of concerns in this issue. Dumbells do so much for our society, but we never even thank them. We call them dumb and don’t
give a second thought. This is not right. These bells are the scaffolding of a healthy and stable society. We are lucky the bells haven’t revolted against us, their
silence is powerful, because they hide their pain, never saying it. Howver, if you do ever decide to ring a bell, you will hear it’s cry, the cry of the injustices of
mankind, the unfair treatment, the bullying.</p>

<p>“I still have hope,” says the local bell, “in the recent years, there are many minorities who have gained access to justice and equal rights, it is only a matter of
time before we get ours. And the best part is, people can help easily. All everyone needs to do is spread the message, rally others to the cause. People need to
realize what they are doing is wrong. Calling them dumbells is demeaning, they are not inferior, but rather they are superior, and should be treated as such. We need
to stop calling them dumbells, maybe strongbells or something is a better suited name but change can be brought.”</p>

<p>The bells have created a Bell Equality Liberating Life movement (BELL for short) and they are gaining many new members per day. With the power of communication, surely
the bells can spread their message and make society a more just one.</p>

    <title>The hunt for H-E-C (An Update on our Legal Troubles pt. 3)</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/07/the-hunt-for-h-e-c-an-update-on-our-legal-troubles-pt-3.html</link>

    <description>An article about The hunt for H-E-C (An Update on our Legal Troubles pt. 3)</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had a problem. Although the (former) Hecrenews had somehow avoided the courtroom (mostly due to the powers of a certain Af Roman), masterful litigator Hon Hon Taj Boxes demanded nothing less than the H-E-C from the (former) Hecrenews. We were reduced to Renews, a frankly quite poor name.</p>

<p>But there was still hope.</p>

<p>Since we had lost our original H, E, and C, all we had to do was procure three more letters. But how would we go about doing that. From what we had learned during the settlement meeting, it took a world-renowned persuader to even try and take letters away from an establishment as powerful as the Hecrenews. We definitely didn’t have one of those up our collective sleeves. But we did have Mister Mjir’s address book. It got us out of trouble in the last two ‘Update on our Legal Troubles’, so we were really hoping for something–or someone– miraculous.</p>

<p>We weren’t disappointed.</p>

<p>HIdden within the folds of the seemingly infinite contact list was not a master procrastinator, or a master intimidator. Instead, there was only an address. I’ll be the first to admit that this was sus, but Mister Mjir was confident in his phonebook that none of us questioned it.</p>

<p>On a dark and gloomy night, we assembled at the location: the local wharf. And sure enough, there it was. A sleek, spiffy cruiser bobbing on the waves. And what a name! Painted in bright gold lettering, the words “S.S. Hookah” seemed to radiate an air of superiority.</p>

<p>“She was once used to carry balloon troopers, back in the old days”, said Mjir. “Used to be a mobile takeoff and landing platform for them. But when they discontinued the balloon trooper program, probably because their balloons kept getting popped, I bought the ship. Gave it a few spiffy upgrades, and here you have it. Little known fact, it was actually made about a week from today, many many years ago.”</p>

<p>After wishing the S.S. Hookah a very happy early birthday, the hecrenews staff <del>(minus the boss, he never  does anything)</del> boarded the ship and we were off to find (and forcibly capture) the letters.</p>

<p><strong>H</strong></p>

<p>First, the H. We first asked the HBA for their H, and after getting roasted horribly for being an inferior organization, we decided to search for another source. The intrepid crew of the S.S. Hookah (also referred to as “we” or “us”) traveled all over until reaching the very narrow shores of Bosnia and HHerzegovina. Apparently having a (former) warship land on your beaches demanding payment isn’t a good thing, so the army showed up to welcome us in full. It didn’t look good, but luckily, Af Roman was on a tour of the lands of his (former) empire (stretched all the way to Britannia!) and decided to tan his afro on the beaches.</p>

<p>Seeing us cornered and about to start (in sing-songy voice) getting shot at (end sing-songy voice), Af Roman quickly intimidated the soldiers and convinced them that they had one more “H” than they knew what to do with. As a thank you for helping them realize this (or maybe they were just too intimidated to act otherwise), the soldiers gave the H to Af Roman. Instead of re-naming himself to Ha(l)f Roman (“100%. Alway full Roman dyude”), Af Roman gave the H to us. After provisionally renaming Renews to Shrewne (we really, <em>really</em> didn’t want to be called Renews for any longer), we set off to find the E.</p>

<p><strong>E</strong></p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the army of what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina wasn’t too inclined to give us another one of their all-too-precious letters, so we set our sights elsewhere. We zoomed halfway around the world to get to where we thought the next letter would be. Thank goodness for those sea currents! In about no time at all, we reached the city of Seattle, home of tech giant Ama-Zone.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the board members weren’t all to keen on giving the Shrewne staff one of their letters. But since they were corporate types, they were willing to trade. Only letter(s) for their E, they said. We were struck dumbfounded. How were we going to pay this, when our name still had two letters missing!?</p>

<p>And at that precise moment, Shroops The Mighty sauntered into the board meeting. Okay, to be honest, he sauntered in a good couple of hours after we were deliberating which letter in which name was the least important (I voted for one of Banana The Human’s “A”’s, because then he could change the rest of his letters into “Ah! Bean Manhunt!”). Shroops, while lacking the intimidatory prowess of Af Roman, did possess numerous procrastination techniques. As soon as (30 minutes after) he walked in, he offered the board members an irresistible deal. They give us their “E”, and Shroops gives them his entire “The Mighty”. 9 for 1 deal! Of course the board members were ecstatic. They quickly quickly gave us the E, and then hungrily turned to Shroops The Mighty, and “un-’the-mighty’-ing” contract already drafted an in their hands.</p>

<p>It was almost like Shroops (still The Mighty) had started to move in slow motion. He made a nearly imperceptible movement towards the contract then another. Slowly but surely, he was actually going to sign! All of us felt great admiration for Shroops’s sacrifice. But then he horribly faked a medical disaster and made us carry him away on a stretcher made from the stretched-out body of Eif al-Tawa. The corporates were incredulously enraged, but they were too old to follow us.</p>

<p>That event might have been in a bit of a legal grey/gray area, but I’m no legal expert, I’ll leave that to Wopps. Still, we had our “E”! I’m sure that this will never come back to bite Shroops The Mighty in the arse (but if it does, you know that the New Shere(khan) (which is what we again provisionally named ourselves) will be there to cover it (unless we forget, or we procrastinate, or a whole bunch of other reasons)).</p>

<p><strong>C</strong></p>

<p>One letter left. But this one seemed like the hardest to get. We had to go all the way to the ice planet Ch’oth and somehow wrangle that “C”, with one little problem. We were still on Earth! How would the New Shere(khan) ever become the hecrenews again!? Luckily, Mister Mjir’s “upgrades” were very numerous. In addition to countless cup-holders, he had installed a pair of rocket engines onto the back. And off we were!</p>

<p>Ch’oth was mighty cold, and the only species there were these camel-things and a big old carnivorous yeti-type. They didn’t look like the kind that would at all notice a letter missing, so we were all poised to take the “C” when Mister Mjir (curse that guy’s goodness!) said we needed to give something in return. So when we finally touched down at (finally) Hecrenews HQ, we set the S. S. Hookah on autopilot, back to that planet. Let the yeti knock itself out zooming across the landscape, I guess.</p>

<p>Huzzah! We were Hecrenews again! No more Renews, take that!</p>

<p>And then finally there was Blat Beck to contend with. Or, as he had recently started calling himself, B. C. Heckle Beta. Heckle Beta had used the (former) Hecrenews’s most sacred letter to create such a monstrosity of a name. Word had spread that he was preparing to ally himself with [that rival blog site that the boss still won’t let any of us mention]. And to think that once upon a time, B. C. Heckle Beta was a hecrenews employee. Oh, how far he has fallen!</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, this Legal Update has really taken its time to come out. Either because the whole staff (writers included) took a multi-stage adventure or procrastination, I’m not really sure. I’ve taken over from Wopps on this series-ting, it seems that as one member returns, another one leaves. Mighty sus, if I do say so myself. I’m not sure if these three articles should be called “An Update on Our Legal Troubles” or “Mjir’s Address Book Hardcore Carries”.</p>

<p>Huh, I was just informed that every Hecrenews writer needs to make daily articles. Whaaat?</p>

<p>Now, I really do need to come up with some sort of signature way to end these articles that isn’t too rambly or anything. Maybe I’ll just pick a random spot to stop wri</p>

    <description>An article about Local Tree Grows an Inch</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local mayor Cäcilie Shaquila started an ambitious project in her city: she wanted to make the city greener by planting some more trees. Trees can provide delicious
oxygen, shade on a hot summer day, habitats for birds, squirrels, and much more, and just look epic. Now our <em>super</em> loyal Renews readers will remember us delving
into the topics of trees before in our previous article on the
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/15/cause-of-trees-swaying.html">cause of trees swaying</a>. So chances are, you already know a lot about trees, because
we know that you too are a loyal Renews reader. However, the topic of this article is about something more special, something worth celebrating. A local tree has
just grown an inch.</p>

<p>Shaquila’s initiative spurred the growth of 1000 trees in the city, definetely taking steps to make it greener, as if you were to take a bird’s eye view photo of the
city after the trees have been planted there would obviously be more green as those are the colors of the tree’s leaves. But, it’s not only green and gets cooler,
as deciduous trees are able to change based on the season, leading to a wide variety of seasonal looks. Now the tree that had just grown an inch was just one of the
thousand. It wasn’t the first one planted in the city square or the last one, this is just one of them, a number if you will. However, the locals have been up-ing
their environmental game in order to keep up with their mayor’s ambitious initiative. Caretakers have been watering the tree, feeding it copious amounts of nitrogen,
and even taking it for walks. Wait, scratch that, that’s from a different article.</p>

<p>Ellena Donelly, Hecrenew’s most famous green-thumb (although arguably not the best) is impressed with the work of Shaquila and the town. “The community is really
being brought together for a good cause. Don’t even think of the environmental benefits, people are supporting people and connecting with each other, and that’s a
beautiful thing to see.” Ellena Donelly visited Shaquila’s town a couple of times and the self-proclaimed green rating (prescribed by Donelly) for the town has
gone up significantly due to the project.</p>

<p>The citizens also have access to much cleaner air, previously the city was plagued by the smoke of many factories, but they were required to switch to more green
and environmental friendly methods. Business owners were at first reluctant because they were going to have to pay big money to sustain a big green business by the
town funded the entire project, so business owners didn’t put up any resistance.</p>

<p>“We’re not stopping there,” says Shaquila, “Next we’re going to implement green terraces on every building, and we will have projects after projects.” Shaquila is
aiming to make her town the greenest place on Earth which is populated by everday citizens.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philip Aleid was coming home from a long day of work very tried. The boss had just made all the employees work overtime as they were releasing a new product tomorrow
and had to ensure everything was in tip top shape. Aleid spent hours in his cubicle doing mundane tasks. Phone calls, spreadsheets, coffee with the homies (arguably
a fun activity) and such that is performed in the office. Aleid was not lucky with the traffic either. Every sigle signal he had to cross was red at first, and
there was even a traffic jam in one road. Now, it is emphasized Aleid is tired, <em>tired</em> I tell you, and he parks his car in the park. At first nothing happens, Aleid
just puts the car on break mode, pulls up the safety break lever, and walks out and locks the doors and goes home. Aleid had a nice sleep after some dinner but
Aleid had just changed his local community as he knew it.</p>

<p>He woke up tomorrow the next day realizing he parked his car in the park instead of the garage  and went to go and get his car, but the park was in chaos. Protestors
were rampant for two sides and omnivore cops were there to settle the dispute, although it was not a dispute dealing with vegetarians and non-vegetarians (The HBA
solved that crisis thankfully). Aleid parked his car in the park, he had given that action no second thought but the other locals did not see it that way. A very
heated debate began dealing with parks which eventually lead to what Aleid was seeing, people yelling at each other, throwing random projectiles, his car heavily
dented with the windows shattered, and gureillas camped in the play area.</p>

<p>The People should Park in Parks movement (P PiP) believed people should be parking in parks. In fact, they are called parks, so it only makes sense for people to park
in them. There are other recreational places proponents argue and those should be used for recreation, there should no longer be any correlation between parks and
recreation as parks should be a place to park and recreation areas are places to do recreational things. As said by Stina Marita, “We cannot let the stigma of our
ancestors stay, we are a progressive society and are far much more inclusive than we were in the past. We should be allowed to park in parks, it’s literally in the
name.”</p>

<p>However, the Parks are Recreational Places Too Gang (PART) believes that parks are recreational places and people should not be allowed to park in them. Proponent
Natan Vitomir gives his opinions, “Parks and Recreation are called parks and recreation for a reason. Parks are places to play, I mean some of them. Others are
national parks, which are preserving the natural environment and the beauty of nature. We cannot destroy that protected haven by letting people park there, parks
are not a place to park, parking lots are. P PiP should realize, a parkling lot means a lot of parking, they can park as much as they want in the parking lot, but
they should not infringe on our parks.” PART has been around for a couple of years, and came to be as direct opposition to P PiP. We do not know who the leaders are
but after obtaining some insightful knowledge from Banana The Human it could be speculated the leaders are just teengaers in gangs, as they are rowdy and like to cause
trouble.</p>

<p>Aleid just wanted his car back but now it was destroyed. P PiP had a large array of cars available to Aleid so he could just take one of their spares but he wanted
his back, but he can’t get it back now. PART will be responsible for the damage done to Aleid’s car but both parties will face punishment for disrupting the natural
order and peace of the local community, For now, Aleid will just continue on his endless mission as a corporate slave.</p>

<p>Lesson learned? Get a good boss (looking at <em>you</em>, boss)</p>

    <title>Email Hackers Bring Man Closer to Everyone in His Contact List</title>

    <description>An article about Email Hackers Bring Man Closer to Everyone in His Contact List</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a surprising turn of events, one man reports being more connected than ever, with the help of some email hackers. Local resident Isaiah Dobrila was previously a very reclusive man. After anonymously donating $10,000,000 USD to try and reduce the cost of healthcare (Dobrila got the sum because he gave his bank account number to a <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/24/man-makes-big-bucks-with-the-help-of-nigerian-prince.html">nigerian prince</a>), Dobrila fell away from the world’s social scene. Prior to the Prince’s generous 10% payment, Dobrila was quite the talky man. He would hit up all the local social gatherings, even the sketchy cult meetings that he wasn’t even supposed to be at. I guess they really can’t tell who’s under the hood. But sadly, that all changed when Isaiah Dobrila received the Prince’s message.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I just realized, you know, once I heard how the Prince’s wife was in danger. I realized that I was pretty lonely in life. Despite all this widespread social interaction, I didn’t really have any true friends. Y’know, people that you can tell all about your snaxing exploits. I was so sad. Well, sad until I found these hit pieces of literature by the HBA”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Dobrila says, he happened to happen upon some very intriguing works published by the HBA, including a Murder &amp; Mystery, and a play. The sheer length of these (as well as trying– and failing– to keep up with the “plot”) utterly engrossed Isaiah. For weeks at a time, the only times he would stop reading were to fulfill necessary bodily functions. In a word, the man was addicted.</p>

<p>As time went on, Isaiah withdrew deeper and deeper into his world of Orange Houses and magic portals. He never went out to parties, never whooped and hollered at sports games, never talked to a soul.</p>

<p>Of course, everybody else was clueless as to the reason behind this sudden introvertedness. The intrepid interviewers of the (Hec)Renews Envestigative Reporting Division (H.E.R.D.) polled some of the passerby on Dobrila’s social disappearance. Formerly pervasive hecrenews correspondent Adalbert Bulstrode said, “He was my good friend, but I haven’t seen him in literal months. This might be because I’ve been holed up, working on a couple secret projects. Yeah, that’s probably it. I’ll meet him at some social gathering or other, he always shows.” Another passerby, without giving us a name, merely answered: “Snaxii. It was the snaxii”. A third voiced suspicion that the kind and generous Nigerian Prince may have betrayed Isaiah and taken his money and information, leaving him too impoverished to show up at parties. Definitely a wide assortment of opinions, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>Isaiah Dobrila recognized that he was slipping away gradually, but the HBA’s enthralling adventures about bombs in planes and tar-and-feathering were just too good. He couldn’t put the stories down, no matter what his subconscious warned him about. But just as Dobrila was going to withdraw into the world of puzzling out every allusion in the M&amp;M, hope struck.</p>

<p>An email. From a person. Wanting to talk to him. How?</p>

<p>Dobrila swiped up the notification immediately and merely grumbled something about getting distracted from his intense reading. But then came another. And another. And another. At some point, Dobrila finally got tired of deleting all his notifications and stopped reading. This was momentous. Then he read one of the emails, also momentous. Here it is, (procured with consent, of course):</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/isaiah_dobrila_email.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>So, some mysterious hackers had managed to crack Dobrila’s account in order to sell Anti-Snaxe Spray. Frankly, Isaiah Dobrila couldn’t care less. That one email had opened his eyes. He saw the benefits of mingling and whatnot, and was forever grateful.</p>

<p>These email hackers had changed the course of Dobrila’s life, in a very much needed way. Dobrila gradually became the social-man of old, all thanks to the flood of emails that connected him with everybody in his contact list (quite an impressive amount, but definitely not as expansive as Mister Mjir’s contacts, of course)</p>

<hr />

<p>There we go, second article all done and dusted and done and finished and done. As my grandaddy once said to me, “rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat”.</p>

    <title>Aliens Travel to the Sun by Flying at Night</title>

    <description>An article about Aliens Travel to the Sun by Flying at Night</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knows the Sun. It may be called different things but all people of all cultures place a huge importance on the Sun. The Sun’s light erodes the darkness
in which fear is brought because it is harder to identify things (which could be dangerous to the primal human). There is a symbolic importance and physical
importance. The Sun provides that sweet sweet vitamin D which probably does something, I’ll have to ask SAR and the Sun allows plants to grow, which is vital for both
vegetarians and non-vegetarians. We see it everyday, and the day itself is determined by the sun (otherwise it would be night). The sun is there as a kid, a teen,
an adult, always looking over us.</p>

<p>When asking the typical man if we can fly to the sun most of them would say “It’s dumb, it’s ridiculous, it’s ouright foolish!” and scientists told us to get out
because we might lower their IQ. Looking at the sun can cause blindness, and most would say most things will just burn up near the sun, just look at planets like
Mercury and Venus, they are hot, and I don’t mean just their looks. Howver, a group of aliens had an ingenious idea, a radical idea, a revolutionary idea which will
change science as we know it.</p>

<p>Most people have mixed feeling about aliens. Scratch that, many people are either scared, hate, or are curious about aliens. Aliens as we portray them typically have
much more advanced technology than we do so of course we humans are scared because we are dominant species and want to stay on top. Luckilly the aliens we ecountered
were pretty chill folks. I think they erased some of my memory so I don’t exactly remember what they look like but I can tell you what they did.</p>

<p>The aliens, like us humans, were too interested in the Sun. But these aliens want to get as hands-on as possible, simply looking at the sun was not satisfying, they
wanted to land on the Sun so they could conduct research and soon create a Dyson Sphere and harness that sweet sweet energy. These aliens are much more intellegent
than humans so they figured out what they needed to do. Of course you couldn’t go to the sun at day, that’s impossible and they would burn up, but if they went at
night…</p>

<p>The aliens spent a wopping week preparing for their expedition. Setting up technology systems, preparing the pilots, running tests after tests to ensure the mission
success. It was a mad week but finally they were ready. Waiting at the perfect time at the perfect location was the rocket, ready for take-off, and the aliens soared.
The aliens ships are far faster than ours, so they reached the Sun in just a couple of minutes casually like it was no big deal, and they landed. There was a lot
they said in our interview.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: “So what was it like?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alien: <em>[REDACTED]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“That’s very interesting, can you describe what you felt, or the emotions you were going through at the time?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>[REDACTED]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Yes yes, it was such a big moment, I understand how you feel, not really, that’s just sympathy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>[REDACTED]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Aw man, you’re so funny. Anyways, was there any ground breaking information you found on the Sun?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>[REDACTED]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So what’s your species gonna do now?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>[REDACTED]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“That’s good. Well, that’s all the time we have for today- oh, and you’re already gone. Gosh darn if only we could reach near light speeds…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The aliens have made a big discovery, but it was not for mankind. The aliens did encourage us to keep trying, and if we tried hard enough, we will eventually
be able to make it to the Sun and achieve all of our goals and other good inspirational stuff. As one local man put the interview:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One large step for the Milky Way and one small step for mankind”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s strange cause we didn’t even set foot on the Sun. Anywho, this was Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

<hr />

<p>Edit by Hecrenews Article Quality Control (HAC): We had to redact all the alien speech under an order from the HBA, it was for our protection, apparently writing in the alien language was dangerous, we do not know how Mister Mjir casually conversed with them.</p>

    <title>Banana the Human Found</title>

    <description>An article about Banana the Human Found</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a quick turn of events. After the recent announcement of the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/03/the-disappearance-of-banana-the-human.html">disappearance of Banana the Human</a> the Renews team was left in shock. After all, Banana was our best author. Despite him posting so rarely, his articles were immaculate, Woops and I can only strive to attain that level of quality and we balance it with quality.</p>

<p>Banana risked his life multiple times and got up-close and personal for his journalism, all journalists should strive for the diligence Banana has. We are glad to see his return. While every author in the Renews are leagues above other news journalists (as we are the only ones covering the full range of the Hecresphere), Banana is a league above the other Renews authors.</p>

<p>On another note, Renews is slowly expanding. Wopps Minor may have dipped on his daily articles but he recruited a new member, Hector from Hector’s House, a show where the main character, Hector, has the head of the Hecretary Bird and the body of a dog. We can’t wait to see these bright and coming authors and what knowledge they have ready to drop in to the whole of the Hecresphere.</p>

<p>Renews is also not in a good state. We did very well in the lawsuit (we have a whole suite of legal troubles, too much to list all so use Renews’ search feature and choose the legal tag). Af Roman was an absolute chad in the courtroom but Hon Hon Taj Boxes was persistent and sued the ‘Hec’ out of Hecrenews, turning us into Renews. This is not good as we will need to update our site name, logo, images, google news page, twitter, and a whole load of other stuff.</p>

<p>We are also facing fierce competition from that other news site you may have heard us talking about in recent articles. They have just passed 1000 total views and we are absolutely bamboozled on how we are not doing as good as them. HAC is saying our articles are not that good but they never said they were not that bad (heh heh…). I heard the boss talking about soon starting a new subdivision thing part of the Renews (formerly Hecrenews) Alphabet Soup Squad, the HAM (Hecrenews Article Marketing, but boss will have to changing it to RAM, Renews Article Marketing Team, responsible for managing the marketing of Renews and expanding our reach to the unenlightened masses.</p>

<p>I guess this article is a call for help. Help us by spreading Renews, share on Twitter, follow us on Twitter, share the links to your friends and ask them to share the link, we cannot lose to that other news site (boss said we can’t reveal their name yet). Anywho, I think this should pass HAC so no need to continue writing and I’m gonna stop right there. This was Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>New Drivers Are Inexplicably Veering into Spinning Cubes on Roads</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/08/03/new-drivers-are-inexplicably-veering-into-spinning-cubes-on-roads.html</link>

    <description>An article about New Drivers Are Inexplicably Veering into Spinning Cubes on Roads</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yo. What’s popping(“Frogs are hopping!”, says Mjir in the background). A lot of you might be wondering where I’ve been. Not to worry, I wasn’t fired or anything. I just decided to do no work at my job whatsoever. It’s a 100% effective strategy to improve your happiness(not your pay, but who cares about that?). I decided to come back because apparently Wopps and Mjir have been under a whole lotta work, and are pretty much brain-dead at this point. So to give them a chance to recharge their brain-juice, I bring to you another pretty bad article that you will learn nothing from.</p>

<p>The boss, hearing about my recent acquisition of a learner’s license, thought that I would be perfect to do a piece on driving safety. Boy was he wrong(Hey boss, if you are reading this, I know you said that you wanted it to promote driving safety, and this article technically kind of doesn’t, but hey, maybe we’ll get like 2 more views than usual. Please don’t fire me).</p>

<p>Some background. The construction firm deMoleish had recently ventured on a new modern art project of adding rotating glass cubes on roads. You know, just your everyday rotating glass cubes, complete with holographic symbols like stars with eyes and flying blue tortoise shells. But what they didn’t anticipate was their immediate destruction.</p>

<p>I sat down with deMoleish unpaid intern Kons Truckson Jr.(he was the only one available to do an interview, because the rest of them were slacking off), to talk about this issue.</p>

<p>“You go by Kons, Truck, or Junior?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Ummm, none of those.” he replied.</p>

<p>“Truck it is, son.” I said, even though I was basically his age. “So what’s going on with these cubes I’ve been hearing so much about?”</p>

<p>“Well, we had it originally planned to be just you know, your average sidewalk construction. But then the boss-”</p>

<p>“Wait. Did you say the boss?”</p>

<p>“Umm, yeah. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“What does he look like? Tall, bearded, has a monocle, never does any actual work?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, actually he does look like that. Again, why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Just because.” I explained, not really explaining anything. My mind drew to the thoughts of our boss, and how he just matched the description I gave to Truck. And then I was rudely interrupted by this ingrate.</p>

<p>“Umm, Banana, as I was saying, the boss wanted to do something different. ‘Instead of the usual sidewalk sculptures, why don’t we do road sculptures. Those are completely safe and definitely needed’ he said. And us, being too scared to say anything, went along with the plan.”</p>

<p>“So you started to place these cubey things around then”</p>

<p>“Yeah, but for some inexplicable reason, which I could probably explain but why spoil the fun, the cubes were shattered by drivers within the first hour of placing them.”</p>

<p>“You ever thought of using something more sturdy then, you know, glass? Maybe a nice cube made of phone screens. Those never seem to break.”</p>

<p>“Nah. We don’t roll like that. Anyway, we were kind of confused about this. And also kind of losing money. So we hired analysizer/gangsta Boops of the Hitman clan, and he noticed quite a weird pattern. Turns out that all the drivers that were breaking the cubes were all relatively new, and some of them stated, though this may be due to their concussions, that they had a crazy urge to just smash into them and destroy the car in front with their turtle coverages. Honestly, I don’t have any idea what that’s about.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like the Hitman clan is active again. I better go get the cats.” I whispered to no one in particular, not even myself.</p>

<p>“Huh, what was that, Banana”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing” I smiled and said. “Well, it’s been a pleasure interviewing you about… whatever we were talking about. Have a nice day, and don’t forget your Anti-Snake Spray, 100% more effective than its competitor Snaxe Spray”</p>

<p>Truck looked confused, but such is the fate of one named Truck. I popped out of the deMoleish HQ, got into my automobile, and drove back to the office furiously. I may have accidentally broken a few of those glass cubes myself, but the information I received was way too important, and these glass cubes were not.</p>

<p>I rushed into the office, starting Wopps, who was quietly snarfing chips while sitting on top of the copy machine.</p>

<p>“Meeting. Now. Conference Room. Wait. We don’t have one of those. Water fountain. Go”</p>

<p>Wopps ran off, and after I gathered Mjir, still kind of mad about being interrupted from his Galaga game, we gathered around the fountain.</p>

<p>“This better be important, Banana, I was just about to pump that guy in the head.” Mjir angrily said.</p>

<p>“Yeah man, I miss the feeling of sitting on the copier machine already” Wopps added(to what he added, no one knows).</p>

<p>“There’s been a development,” I said. “We might finally have a lead. To the one that tunnels”</p>

<p>Wopps spit out his potato chips. “WHAT? Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“I’m positive. The Hitman clan has come out of hiding, and this might be the only chance we have to find an old friend.”</p>

<p>We all looked at each other, our faces showing mixes of worry and excitement. After a long minute in thought, I went ahead and spoke.</p>

<p>“I’ll go get the cats”</p>

    <description>An article about The disappearance of BananaTheHuman</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You, the dear and loyal Renews reader who has diligently read every article to date, may have noticed the recent lack of articles by one Banana The Human, who commonly goes by Banana. Although we recently suspected that he was away on some pear-related business (as usual), Banana’s prolonged disappearance makes us think that this is no longer the case.</p>

<p>Banana hasn’t clocked in for an article-writing shift in days, weeks even. After the first death threats from the boss, the rest of us staff got worried (at that point in time, we were still called Hecrenews). Where had he gone? After lengthy deliberations, we decided to put search posters all over the area. Maybe somebody had seen Banana recently.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/banana_the_human_search_poster.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, nobody called the number or visited the <del>interrogation</del> meeting spot. We were dismayed. Sunken into the depths of depression, we feared that Banana was gone for good. To try and salvage our own happiness, Mister Mjir tuned into the ongoing HBA <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/28/hba-begins-livestreaming-on-streaming-juggernaut-twitch.html">Twitch stream</a> and we were in for quite the surprise.</p>

<p>BananaTheHuman, casually playing for the audience. Like nothing was wrong. Now, this was very extremely sus. We had evidence that he was still active, but no clue of his whereabouts. Banana had also turned off all formerly known methods of contacting him, from his phone to smoke signals, to even leaving a piece of cheese in a specific corner of the Hagia Sophia. Nothing worked.</p>

<p>We do miss Banana and all of his contributions to Renews (contributed back when it was Hecrenews) will stay as legacies of a great time.</p>

<hr />

<p>Edit by Hecrenews Article Quality Control (HAC): Hector forgot to mention that he/she/it is a new author for Renews, hired on the basis of the stark reality of a permanently AWOL BananaTheHuman. Unless Banana can be located, Hector seems here to stay.</p>

    <description>An article about New Commercial Enzyme Catalyzes Life Itself</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new commercial enzyme has made a giant splash on the health supplement scene lately. Its creator, famed mad scientist Dixon von Oriole, says that this enzyme has the potential to “revolutionize the entire industry”. But what does this enzyme do, exactly? Von Oriole gives us more in an exclusive <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/01/hecrenews-gets-serach-feature.html">Renews</a> interview.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interviewer: “So, what does this enzyme do exactly? I’ve heard a lot about it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Von Oriole: “Well, enzymes catalyze things, right?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interviewer: “Yep.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Von Oriole: “Don’t interrupt me. This enzyme acts ju–”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interviewer: “Didn’t you just ask me a question.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Von Oriole: “<em>Didn’t you just</em> INTERRUPT ME AGAIN!?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interviewer: “…”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Von Oriole: “Much better. As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, this enzyme catalyzes things just like other enzymes available on the market; however, it does have one major distinguishing quality.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interviewer: “And what wou–”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>At this point, Dixon von Oriole has shot a lazer-like glare at the interviewer, which effectively shuts him/her up.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Von Oriole: “The quality is this: My enzyme catalyzes life itself! It’s magical! It’s miraculous! It’s mostly-legal!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interviewer: “What was that last part?”</p>

<p>This enzyme has caused quite a stir, and many people, curious, have tried it to see if it really does catalyze life itself. Unfortunately, they were not available for comment. Bingus Tingus III was reportedly sighted ingesting said enzyme, but declined to be interviewed. He was too busy sleeping, and nothing our interviewer did would wake him up.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen just what this miracle enzyme can do. Multiple big corporate firms had hired teams of scientists to try and reverse engineer the magical substance, but they all mysteriously dropped dead after testing it. Highly sus, if I do say so myself.</p>

<p>Short Article, I know, but I had to get within that limit. Maybe the boss will stop threatening me now, but it remains to be seen. Wopps Out.</p>

    <title>Update on the M and M (New Progress)</title>

    <description>An article about Update on the M and M (New Progress)</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A leaked meeting was revealed to the HBA team involving the progress on the M&amp;M, and it is good news! The HBA was planning to finish the book before the next school
year began, but had so far made no progress on the book. In the leaked meeting, we discovered that the M&amp;M has already finished phase 1 out of 2 of their planning, with
phase 2 planning on being finished today. Soon the HBA will start writing the book, and they will definetely get it finished by the school year start (they say).</p>

<p>If you are behind and confused on this M&amp;M business, I highly recommend checking out this
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/04/hba-book.html">great article</a> written by the Hecrenews explaining what it is. We don’t know what it’s about yet,
but we are sure it’s going to change literature as we know it. Book are too boring for most people, and the HBA is striving to make the M&amp;M a book anyone, even the
book haters, will read. We can only hope they are not rushing it, as that will dillute the quality we are so hoping for. With the HBA’s expections for the book to
change modern literature as it stands, every character in the book musy be immaculate.</p>

<p>The M&amp;M is going to be an enjoyable book on the surface level but by analyzing it or just giving thought to it when reading, there is a whole layer of depth hidden
between the lines. A lot of deep questions about the human nature as well as reavling the human nature and battling ideals. There are going to be many themes, and
there are many events happening at the small and big picture scale.</p>

<p>Anywho there’s not that much that happened, but it’s cool to see the HBA actually start writing the book now that they have procrastinated and can begin the grind.</p>

<p>In other news (yes a double feature) we will be pausing upgrades to the Hecrenews. We have settled with the current design plans as we haven’t recieved many suggestions,
we will still take your suggestions and implement them, we just can’t spend the scarce energy required to do it ourselves. The homescreen is tailored for mobile,
small screens, and big computer screens. Our search feature now allows you to search by tags so you can quickly find articles you’re interested in.</p>

<p>Guess that’s it for me, spread the Hecrenews today and say ‘Good Day’ to the HBA!</p>

<hr />

<p>Edit by Hecrenews Article Quality Control (HAC): It’s the M&amp;M but the title of this article is M and M due to technical reasons, please refer to it as the M&amp;M</p>

    <description>An article about Renews gets new search feature</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gotta finish this article fast fast fast! Don’t wanna lose that daily streak now.</p>

<p>Hecrenews got lots of visual updates, looks epic now. Latest section looks so cool, but
we still need to update teh stuff below that, that’s not looking that cool and we gotta make
it look super cool.</p>

<p>Anywho we finally got a search feature. Right now this is a very basic search feature,
there isn’t that much you can do. Right now you can only serach up a specific tag,
and you gotta spell it right and capitalize it right.</p>

<p>That’s literally it, I’m running out of time. Probably stay tuned for a much better search
feature tomorrow, bye folks!</p>

    <description>An article about Blat Beck sues Hecc out of Hecrenews (An Update on Our Legal Troubles pt.2)</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, this has failed catastrophically.</p>

<p>The whole <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/30/an-update-on-our-legal-troubles.html">“procrastination” plan</a> that we’d put in place basically amounted to next to nothing. Although I tried to tell the numerous plaintiffs that I was busy and otherwise engaged and was about to start hibernating right there at the joint meeting, they refused to listen. Something about having to wait for months and months for the Hecrenews to even start having at least one bumbling fool in the legal division, but I digress.</p>

<p>Even though I had so many plans of a great legal defense in my head, it turned out that I actually needed to execute them for them to have any effect. But just thinking of all those hours creating briefs and filing appeals just made my head spin. I followed the lessons that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/creator_of_africa">Shroops the Mighty</a> gave me, but just ended up spending my time doing nothing and milling about until the big meeting.</p>

<p>Luckily, I was again visited by one of Mister  Mjir’s associates only minutes before the plaintiffs started filing in. This was, of course, the legendary Af Roman himself. A very mysterious character, previously known to me only by the fact that he was Roman Af. Still, his legendary powers were world-renowned. As much as Shroops the Mighty was an expert in procrastination, Af Roman was the world’s authority on the art of intimidation. And this time, I didn’t even have to take a lesson! Roman said that he would accompany me into the meeting room, and I was infinitely grateful.</p>

<p>And so it began. Your very own Wopps and Af Roman on one side of the table, facing four very aggravated prosecutors. There was a tall built boy with a squeaky voice, a kind-but-firm-looking representative of the HBA, an attorney for Biggin Mammo (who couldn’t attend in person on account of that comma he fell into), and finally their leader: The craftiest prosecution attorney this side of Chatanooga. Representing Blat Beck (who could attend for obvious reasons), Mr. Hon Hon Taj Boxes oozed confidence as he contemplated the situation.</p>

<p>But the Hecrenews’s weapon, Af Roman had a couple tricks up his sleeve as well. Like many, he had migrated to Mount Himalaya as a child in order to learn the ways from the assorted group of legendary figures residing up there. He had a vast assortment of intimidation techniques with which he could dispose of the opposition.</p>

<p>And so it began (for real this time). There was no fighting, but it was a battle nonetheless. A battle of minds. First came the handshake. Roman and I shook hands with squeaky-boy, the HBA representative, and Mr. Taj Boxes normally, but Biggin Mammo’s attorney had another thing coming. He stretched out his right hand as normal, unwitting of the dreadful ordeal he would soon face. But while the attorney outstretched his right hand, Roman expertly stuck out his left. The tension in the room was about 89.65N, a very high number. There they stood, stock-still, with the opposite hands outstretched. After about 30 minutes of experiencing Af Roman’s powers, the attorney capitulated. Stuck out his left hand and while it may have seemed to be a normal handshake from the perspective of an uneducated outsider, everybody in the room could tell that Roman had officially asserted his dominance over the attorney (except me, Af Roman filled me in on most of this after the fact).</p>

<p>After the attorney was suitably intimidated, we got down to business. As the hosts of the meeting, it was up to us to set suitable precedents. Being Roman Af, Af Roman decided that we should only speak in Latin. The HBA representative and Hon Hon Taj Boxes seemed perfectly fine, but not squeaky-boi (and me of course). I guess they didn’t offer Latin at his school or something. Squeaky-boi just sat there (a lot like me), not contributing anything or arguing for himself, because well, he just couldn’t. Another point for the hecrenews!</p>

<p>Two people left, who were probably specialists in not being intimidated. Luckily, Af Roman had a secret weapon: his Afro. He took a momentary break from the argument and (while maintaining constant eye contact) procured some water, sprinkled some on his hands, and ran his hands through the afro. The effect was immediate. The Afro stood up, twice or thrice its previous volume. The sheer effect caused me to <em>almost</em> kowtow, and the afro wasn’t even directed towards me! I can’t imagine what must have been going on in those two’s heads.</p>

<p>After the dust settled, it looked very promising. Even the legendary Hon Hon Taj Boxes seemed the slightest bit shaken. Of course, the others were completely and utterly demoralized. The HBA representative gave us an infinitely long extension on that lobbying action. Squeaky-boi just fled the scene, perhaps he had had enough. Biggin Mammo’s attorney said that Mammo wouldn’t sue if the Hecrenews kept a supply of chocolates going to his hospital bed. I asked how chocolates would help him in his comma, but the attorney somehow found it in himself to be stubborn and Af Roman was just too lazy to force the chocolates away.</p>

<p>Hon Hon Taj Boxes was a different story altogether. He’d managed to withstand the intimidating assault, somehow. But having had a taste of Af Roman’s raw power, Boxes agreed to a settlement. However, he told us that his client literally wanted to sue the “hecc” out of “hecrenews”. Through extreme negotiations, we managed to cut one “C” out of the deal, but we still had to give Blat Beck an H, E, and C. Guess we’ll be renamed to the Renews from now on, unless we can find some way to stop this. A large thanks is in order to Af Roman, without who the situation would have been much worse.</p>

<hr />

<p>Dang it, missed another article. Oh well. Wopps out. Once again. The end. Hopefully the article was long enough to make up for yesterday. Oof. Starting to worry if that up-and-coming news network will outpace us, with the shoddy job everybody except Mister Mjir has been doing with daily articles.</p>

    <title>Hecrenews Getting an Upgrade</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/07/31/hecrenews-getting-upgraded.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/07/31/hecrenews-getting-upgraded.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Hecrenews Getting an Upgrade</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alright loyal Hecrenews viewers, it’s time for an upgrade.</p>

<p>Remember we here at the Hecrenews are not after your money or want anything, we care about our loyal readers, fans, and supporters!
There are multiple metrics we use to measure how well our site is doing, the one spurring these updates is the scores on
google page speed index, or google psi for short. We noticed a drop in our page speed score, this was terrible! We used to have
a high score of ~98-100 but it had dropped all the way to 76, and since we care about our readers and your experience, we immediately
went on the grind to fix it.</p>

<p>Also, we are implementing a new layout update, your favorite news site is gonna have a similar layout, but we are making changes
to make our site faster for a smoother experience. We are still in the middle of these changes, so the site breaking is prone to
happen and we are sorry for the inconveniences, but once we are done it’s going to be better than ever.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-problem">The main problem</h2>

<p>The main problem we were having was the loading of images. To provide the best quality for our readers, we chose many high
resolution images, but this is having a negative impact on the performance of our site and will consume our user’s cellular data,
which we do not want to do. This change will not be too hard to implement, but will be tedious and will take a while. We will
start using lower resolution images, but they will still be of high quality. In addition, we will make even smaller images tailored
for our homepage specifically, as there are many small versions of images used on the homepage. After these implements, we should
be expecting a higher score.</p>

<h2 id="layout-changes">Layout changes</h2>

<p>You can already see one of the new layout changes at the time of this article. Notice in our News and HBA section the image doesn’t
show up, you would have to hover on the image for it to show up, and yes we are still working on our mobile but mobile support
will come out a little bit later once we nail the new layout. The design choice will allow us to load fewer images, and you will
only need to load the images for the articles you are interested in! In addition, this new ‘hover’ feature will also allow us to
soon display article previews, so you can look for the perfect article to read while browsing for news.</p>

<p>Other than that we don’t have too much planned for the layout changes. We would love to make it a lot better and you can give us
suggestions by emailing hecretarybird@gmail.com, make the subject ‘Hecrenews Layout Suggestion’ or something and give us some ideas.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-we-better">Why are we better</h2>

<p>Check out Google’s tool right <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">here</a> and plug in some other news sites you
know, you might be shocked to find out the scores they get. We want a fast and smooth experience and we set our standards as high
as the Hecretary Bird can fly (and that’s really high), we are already the best news source in the Hecresphere, but we will strive
to be a more reliable and trustworthy news source compared to our competitors.</p>

    <description>An article about An Update on Our Legal Troubles</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hecrenews has a bit of a problem. No doubt you, our extremely loyal reader, already know what that is, so I’ll skip the background of this issue completely.</p>

<p>Just kidding.</p>

<p>Over the several months that we’ve been active, the Hecrenews has gotten into some very scary legal issues. I was supposed to handle a <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/11/as-robocalls-become-more-prominent-teens-fight-to-preserve-a-way-of-life.html">rubber poisoning lawsuit</a> some time ago, but rip. Short term memory loss, I guess. <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/20/writing-in-all-caps-found-to-be-more-persuasive.html">Blat Beck</a> is also suing the hecc out of the hecrenews over a <del>teeny-tiny</del> [very emotionally scarring ordeal that the Hecrenews feels sympathy for], and this, as you probably can tell, isn’t a good thing. We’re actively trying to be nice to <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/13/very-dear-friends-of-local-man-astonished-at-will-to-live.html">Biggin Mammo</a> so that he won’t sue us when he wakes up from the comma. And very recently, the HBA has put pressure on us to lobby to designate the desert that <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/21/one-man-to-take-revenge-on-deserts-for-enormous-weight-gain.html">Bert Bulstrode</a>  is currently 1/3rd done with as an important <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/29/hecretary-proponents-protest-de-desertification-of-historic-battle-site.html">historical site</a>. Whew, that was a lot of links. I guess we really are in a lot of trouble.</p>

<p>So, the staff of the Hecrenews sat down and debated the possible solutions. That was the plan, but in reality chief smarty-dyude Sheeple Dunnell went to DC, Eif al-Tawa was off somewhere bullying schoolchildren and acting evil in general, Biggin Mammo and Blat Beck were both in the hospital (by no fault of the Hecrenews), BananaTheHuman had yet more pear-related business, and everybody else had some sort of thing or the other to keep them busy. That left me.</p>

<p>I was all alone to fend off this mountain of legal cases, with my only qualifications being that I went to 1 debate tournament and read a couple John Grisham novels. Luckily, being very creative, I had no problem in coming up with a flawless legal strategy that can be summarized in just a couple of words: Procrastinate until the prosecution gets too bored to continue. Genius, right? Unfortunately, us at the hecrenews have lost our sense of procrastination, thanks to the boss’s thrice-daily article regimen. We needed some professional help.</p>

<p>Good thing that Mister Mjir has a vast network of associates. He talked to one of his specialists, Shroops the Mighty and managed to get me a 1 on 1 training session with the man. Now, you may not know much about this legendary character, so the previous sentence may not have had a huge impact. But it <em>was</em> huge. In addition to being a contender in a much-anticipated boxing match, creating an entire continent, and participating in hit music group “The Little Black Men at the Palace”, Shroops the Mighty (colloquially referred to simply as Shroops) is a master procrastinator. I was ecstatic. Maybe our legal strategy would actually work!</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/shroops_the_mighty_insta.JPG" alt="" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><em>Official social media of Shroops the mighty. Quite impressive, if I do say so myself</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Shroops arrived approximately 6.5 hours late to the training session, but it just added to the suspense. I learned all the main procrastination techniques, including but not limited to excuses, distractions, daydreaming, and even the advanced technique of hibernation. I was now an official master of procrastination. Thus armed, I would be capable of single-handedly holding back the tsunami of litigation.</p>

<hr />

<p>Actually, winter’s looking pretty close. I’ll finish this article in a couple months, I swear. Stay tuned for part 2. Wopps <em>(yawns)</em> out.</p>

    <title>Local Man eats Cloud: Tastes like Cotton Candy</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/07/30/local-man-eats-clouds-taste-like-cotton-candy.html</link>

    <description>An article about Local Man eats Cloud: Tastes like Cotton Candy</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As children we all wonder, “what does a cloud taste like?” There are so many clouds in the sky, but most of us want to take a nice big bite out of cumulus or
cumulonimbus clouds. While I would love to include all the cloud types and pictures to artifically include article length but that’s just too much effort (uh oh,
I have a feeling HAC’s not gonna like that). It’s so nice, big, warm, fluffy, soft, and delicious, but has anyone actually every tasted one of these magnificent
<em>things</em>? Matthia Lucilla is the man with a plan who was set on tasting a cloud.</p>

<p>Matthia Lucilla first saw a cloud at the age of 7, believe it or not (you better believe, we are the most reliable news source in the Hecresphere). Seeing the clouds
changed his life, he immediately began learning all he could about clouds. Soon elementary school teachers had nothing to teach Lucilla as he already knew the nuances
between stratus, cirrus, cumulus, stratocumulus, cirrostratus, cirrocumulus, nimbostratus, altostratus, altocumulus, and cumlonimbus clouds! That’s a mouthful, good
thing I paid attention in elementary school and memorized those, I certainly did not search those up on Google… Lucilla was the cloud man, and became a powerful
force in his school because of his knowledge of clouds. Lucilla was getting all the girls despite not being the fastest runner in the grader (a total shock and shift
of the power system, revolutionizing elementary school dating life as we know it), however, if Lucilla truly wanted power, he would start an underground school
organization like <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/27/billa-the-rise-and-fall-of-an-undergound-school-organization.html">Billa</a>, Lucilla was just
a boy with a dream and a love of clouds.</p>

<p>As Lucilla got older he still wanted to know more, he craved the cloud knowledge and would spend most of his free time just gazing at clouds. When he was called in for
lunch he realized he never knew what a cloud tasted like. He started staying after school in his chemistry class trying to make clouds and played around with water,
the condensation and perspiration ting (as mentioned by my man Big Shaq himself) but he wanted to taste that natural cloud. Upon consulting literal genius Adalbert
Bulstrode (no relation to the fame-gaining Bert Bulstrode (once spelt Bullstrode)) Lucilla realized he could not (sadly) climb up to the clouds, the base of the ladder
would be too unstable and that’s not even considering wind, air pressure, and UFOs. Lucilla was stumped.</p>

<p>Lucilla kept on going to school and consuming that knowledge, he became #1 in his class and scored a 100 in everything: by mastering all the subjects he could learn
and know more about clouds, his one passion in life. It his Lucilla in geography class, he had to climb a mountain. If he got to a high enough altitude, he would be
able to soak himself in the cloud. He could not only eat the cloud, but be in the clouds essence, become the cloud if you will. Lucilla just needed to find a mountain.
Lucilla decided to choose mount Himalaya, as the legendary man Shri Ballaji was said to meditate there for years upon years.</p>

<p>After spending two years learning how to climb mountains, Lucilla was finally ready to climb, and he was already an expert. In only one day’s time, he saw his dream,
his life. He was inside a cloud. Lucilla took a deep breath, and the air was the cleanest and freshest air he had ever breathed. He was ready for the moment he had
been waiting for his entire life, he took a large bite of the cloud. “It was delicious,” he said, “I am now satisfied with my life, anyone could be after tasting
that.” Lucilla had just achieved his dream of eating a cloud. Unfortunately Lucilla was unable to build his dream home there because of the high altitude but he was
happy for what he good, the most critical moment of his life.</p>

<p>Lucilla is now a meterologist working somewhere but surely the HBA will recruit a talent like him soon so guess we’ll be seeing him again. Anyone can achieve their
dreams if they believe and work hard like Lucilla, at Hecrenews we report the big stories of big mans, in hopes that one day you too can become a big man. Chase after
your dreams and don’t regret not chasing them.</p>

    <title>Internet Still Exists Reports Local</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/07/29/internet-still-exists-reports-local.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/07/29/internet-still-exists-reports-local.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Internet Still Exists Reports Local</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nikša Cole discovered something very important today: the internet still exists.</p>

<p>Many people have long forgotten about the internet, it is a relic of the past when computers needed entire rooms and couldn’t fit on one desk. To really understand
the findings of Cole, we must first understand what the internet is. Inter means to place a corpse in a grave or tomb and net is a meshed bag. Hold up, this just in
form the Hecrenews English and Reading Team (EAR) that is not correct. Apparently inter is short for interconnected, which basically just means connected, and net is
short for network. An interconnected network of computers, but what exactly is a computer?</p>

<p>Most people believe computers are the laptops or the desktops which run Windows and do many stuff. Some people call them PC for Windows OS and Mac for Apple’s OSX
despite a PC just being short for personal computer not related to the operating system. However, the Hecrenews Technology Investigation Core and the Hecrenews
Technology Analysis Core (TIC TAC) have really dived deep into the history and mystery of computers to help me write a compelling article the boss will approve of
as well as Hecrenews Article Quality Control (HAC). A computer is simply something that calculates things, it ‘computes’ stuff. Our brains are calculators, and animal
brains are probably some of the earliest ones. Abacuses are also computers. For those of you hip modern e-kids playing all that Fortnite and don’t know about good ‘ol
books, vhs, here is a picture of an abacus (My homie Kawolski from the Pengiuns of Madagascar can be seen using it):</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/abacus_stock_photo.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>However, most locals believed I was crazy when I interviewed when I asked if they though an abacus was a calculator. 69% reported to not know what an abacus, 26.8%
reported “No,” and 4.20% reported “Gone and solid gone.” These days we can just consider a computer to be something with a processor. A phone, a microwave, your car,
all of these are valid computers. Now we basically know the jist of what a computer is, so we can get popping into this internet stuff.</p>

<p>A computer can connect to another computer, and this process can get real complicated real fast. There are a bunch of big bad, tall mean lean and green servers all
around the world, and a server is just another kind of computer. Many locals call this the ‘cloud’ despite the cloud being the delicious fluffy things in the sky
(article on that coming soon <em>hint hint wink wink nudge nudge</em>). Anywho, these servers are connected through various methods, one of them are the fiber optic cables
that run along the ocean floor which allows us to link up with the homies overseas. These big servers are connected to a bunch of smaller servers and some of these
are manages by your ISP and run into your house! In your very own house you can set up a local area network (LAN) and connect devices to other devices in that (LAN)
network, which is pretty cool.</p>

<p>But all this techno mumbo jumbo makes no sense, so let’s talk about something that does. The internet is place where introverts and extroverts alike go, read news
(I recommend the Hecrenews, great news site), read books, play games, do school. Our lives have gotten really dependent on the interet, and Cole’s discovery of the
internet still existing is very important to our human infrastructure. The internet is not an obsolete item of the past, it is real and it is now. Cole just hopped
onto twitter to check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/hecrenews">Hecrenew’s twitter account</a> and had a realization the internet was still there.</p>

<p>The internet has everything, if you have a device and an internet connection you can learn anything. If you are reading this, you already have both! Freelancing,
business, coding, marketing, etc., the possibilities are endless! This is just a reminder giving you guys hope the HBA is always there for you.</p>

    <title>Hecretary Proponents Protest De-desertification of Historic Battle Site</title>

    <description>An article about Hecretary Proponents Protest De-desertification of Historic Battle Site</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember Bert Bulstrode? Aside from suggesting some quite frankly frightening <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/24/local-sports-team-loses-faith-in-humanity-after-name-selection-competition.html">team names</a>, Bulstrode has recently become famous for his quest to dig up an unknown <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/21/one-man-to-take-revenge-on-deserts-for-enormous-weight-gain.html">desert</a>. During his excavation efforts, Bulstrode uncovered several insteresting curiosities, including rudimentary stone tools, a live ostrich, an intricately detailed model of the Statue of Hecretary, but with a moustache on it, and most curiously: a single fang. These curiosities were sent to the Hecrenews Science and Research Team. Lead nerdy-man Sheeple Dunnell promptly pronounced the assortment of items as “mad sus” and handed the situation to the infinitely more qualified HBA Artifact Analysis Commitee (AAC).</p>

<p>Within a matter of hours, the precise origin of each object, prepared by the AAC, was ready. (Even though the material summary was prepared so quickly, this article came out weeks later. What can I say? Procrastination sure is powerful..) The report stated that every object was exactly as it seemed and nothing unusual, except for the fang. From a calcium sample, the very productive scientists at the AAC reached an astonishing conclusion: the fang belonged to none but The Evil Snaxe himself. That’s right, the very snaxe that had a Legendary Battle with Hecrusander the Great, where both ceased to exist, creating the major and minor snaxii and the leg-snapping syndrome found in hecretary birds. This battle was thought to have been fought in an unknown desert, but it turns out that the desert is known, after all.</p>

<p>According to a spokesperson for the HBA Artifact Analysis Committee, this discovery “changed the very nature of our understanding of the Legendary Battle”. In layman’s terms, this fancy quote means that the discovery changed the very nature of our understanding of the Legendary Battle. According to the quickly revised version of the story, when The Evil Snaxe bit the leg joint of Hecrusander the Great in his dying attempt to harm the great bird, its fang must have dislodged. (Snaxii, even today, are really quite negligent towards proper dental care) Some time later, when Hecrusander has disentegrated into brick-like pebbles and The Evil Snaxe had fled in the form of the major and minor snaxii, the group that carried Hecrusander’s pebbles away from the battleground most likely by some miracle never even noticed the enormous, gleaming fang in the sand. As the years  passed, this desert miraculously remained where it was. (Which is probably more proof that climate change isn’t real)</p>

<p>Well, the findings of the study incited quite the storm. A giant wave of hecretary proponents immediately voiced their surprise at this change in lore and also their outrage at Bulstrode’s activity. As they saw it, Bulstrode was digging up the precious site of this battle, which ought to be preserved. And so they showed up to protest their feelings. With very <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/20/writing-in-all-caps-found-to-be-more-persuasive.html">persuasive</a> signage, too. According to a protester that preferred to stay anonymous, Bulstrode was “straight up defiling” the desert. Still, it’s unclear if the protest is  affecting Bulstrode, or if he’s even noticed it. Such his is single-minded motivation to exact revenge on “deserts”.</p>

<p>Still, the veritable army at the edge of the hole Bert Bulstrode has dug can’t do much. That’s why they are seeking a way to make the higher-ups in government designate this now very special desert as a historic landmark, which would make it illegal to defile. Hopefully they get somebody else to do their dirty work, and not a shady organization with far-reaching influence, such as the Hecrenews. We have quite enough on our legal plate, thank you. And another thing. Hopefully the snaxii or their followers don’t read the hecrenews. If this fang was to fall into  their hands, it would be very dangerous indeed. It may finish the development of the iSnaxe, or even worse, allow the snaxii to combine into the dreadeed Evil Snaxe.</p>

<p>But for now, Bulstrode digs. And digs. And digs some more.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, it seems like old Wopps is the first to break from the daily article regimen. I sure do hope the boss doesn’t notice, or you may not hear from me ever again. Wopps out, for hopefully less than 24 hours.</p>

<p>EDIT by Hecrenews Article Quality Control - The Hecrenews Historical Analysis Team (HAT tells us to tell you to please note that the actual history of the battle between the Hecretary Bird and the Evil Snaxe are still not set in stone; it is a very challenging feat for groups of historians like HAT to handle because a long time back there was a project where our ancestors had to recite the story, while most extrapolated like they should’ve one guy fabricated the story causing many inconsistencies and we cannot figure out the true history, thus it remains a mystery.(In detail, some versions don’t have a name for the Hecretary Bird, and other versions the Hecretary Bird does not turn into pebbles, may need to update Hecrepedia about this…)</p>

    <title>HBA Begins Streaming on Streaming Juggernaut Twitch</title>

    <description>An article about HBA Begins Streaming on Streaming Juggernaut Twitch</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aye aye aye! Who’s flow is that? That’s right, daily articles are back! Hopefully not for a limited time.</p>

<p>Today we will be talking about HBA newest endevaors in their attempts to expand their audience. The HBA has recently created a
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hecretarybird">Twitch</a> account to being doing livestreams. Some representatives from the HBA say it is an attempt to increase the HBA’s
following by expanding their reach into new waters. Other representatives say it’s just for fun. Well, whatever the reason may be the online expansion of the HBA
can clearly be seen.</p>

<p>The internet is uncharted territory. I am not talking about deep and dark web stuff, know that what you see in search engines are only the tip of the iceberg, there is
so much stuff on the deep web and even more on the dark web! In the old days, people had to claim land, the problem is now all the land is basically claimed and the
United Nations group tries to settle this kind of stuff. While you cannot claim land, you can still perform territorial expansion on the internet. Become the face
of all the big services, YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, all sorts of social medias to compete in. However, the HBA is facing a rough start and it will take a long time for
them to surpass 10 views at a time (which is much greater than 2).</p>

<p>Currently the HBA videos are claiming to be a Hecretary Bird Association fundraiser, but was pretty lackluster. It was simply a screen displaying some epic HBA
propoganda (gotta love that stuff man) but the main manager of the account has souped it up by adding GIFs and we can not forget about our main man Cromwell in the
King Henry video displayed. Some local people have speculated a strange incident. Apparently yesterday and today the HBA actually started streaming stuff. One local
man said the game looked like League of Legends but wasn’t too sure as most of the stream was just a black screen with a cursor bouncing around. The strangest part
was that the videos were taken down.</p>

<p>Why are the HBA taking down their old streams? What kind of secrets were exposed then? We are not too sure, some locals report they were probably just testing it out
and those streams were never meant to be seen in the first place. Oh no, wait, hold up… Gosh darn, I forgot to ask the locals for their names! I was too focused on
grinding the articles and I forgot. Sorry boss. But anywho, seems the HBA is learning how the streaming service is working and they are prepping for some epic games
and epic gameplays. Will they just be playing League or will they be diverse and try out other games? Are they only streaming games? There are so many questions to be
raised. Hopefully the HBA stays active with this as the Twitter is pretty lackluster and the Hecrepedia and Hecrenet are no longer being updated despite there being
information not moved from the Hecrepedia 1.0 to the Hecrepedia 2.0. The Hecrepedia 1.0 was even taken down but the new Hecrepedia still links there, the HBA’s really
gotta update that.</p>

<p>Well, the HBA is a pretty promising group so we should expect pretty promising results. Backed by the H-Bird itself the HBA will be able to do anything. Stay tuned
to their new Twitch channel as well as the Hecrenews, we gotta get more views, seriously. This was Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>

    <title>Hecrenews Determines Whether or not it is Opposite Day</title>

    <description>An article about Hecrenews Determines Whether or not it is Opposite Day</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Humanity has progressed far in our many years of existence. We’ve restructured the world itself, and we’ve changed throughout the eras. But one thing remains constant, for all of us. The asking of certain essential questions, intrisic to every human. Why are we here? Are we alone? Will we ever get ARMD’s <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/03/music-group-recieves-backlash-on-song-delay.html">new album</a>? And finally, probably the most pressing of them all: Is it Opposite Day today?</p>

<p>But first, a slight introduction. While you of course will have no earthly idea as to when it is, we all know what it is. One dreaded day, on which every little thing you say means the opposite of its intended meaning. “Mr. Heinreich Pickleblower has been found not guilty and absolved of all charges” would end up very badly indeed. Here’s a much more professional definition of Opposite Day. It’s professional because “E = mc^2, and Newton weighed more than Bohr”, says the chief smarty-pants of the Hecrenews Science and Research team.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/urban_dictionary_opposite_day.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Opposite Day neck gaiters aside, let’s get to the meat of the issue. Like a skulking shadow, you never know if a given day is opposite day, until its far too late. Ever since we were little and first introduced to this altogether quite troubling notion that any day might be opposite day, and if we didn’t realize it we were doomed, we’ve known that this horrible anxiousness must be put to an end. For this reason, the Hecrenews Science and Research Team was tasked with finding the solution to this problem: determining whether or not a given day was Opposite Day.</p>

<p>After perusing a veritable mountain of sciencey texts, the team found not even a mention of Opposite Day. Nobody before had even attempted to divine a method to predict this dastardly day; they were probably far too scared. Such was the terrifying power of this holiday. After looking through what all of science had to offer and being sorely disappointed, the intrepid nerds of the Hecrenews Science and Research team decided to turn to history. Perhaps by examining past probable occurences of Opposite Day, they would stumble upon a pattern. And so they hit the books (again).</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was the chief himself, Sheeple Dunnell, who found the first probable occurence. On July 21, 1861, during the first battle of Bird Run in the Hecretarian Civil War, Union commander Birdfield Scott famously remarked, “Boy-o, we’re gonna win this”. Sadly, the Union never did.</li>
  <li>April 1st, 1666. Somebody in an ancient Chinese text declared his intense intent to use the restroom. He then went to the restroom. This may seem like everything is in order, but you have to consider the special circumstances of April 1st, which make this sort of like a double negative.</li>
  <li>Cheetos, get ‘em while they’re hot!</li>
  <li>Measly little intern Eif al-Tawa scrounged about in a medival edition of the hecrepeda and found that The Evil Snaxe said “not one of us is good or evil, but you are evil for antagonizing me…” to Hecrusander the Great during the Legendary Battle, which took place on an unknown day sometime after years of technological warfare. This, while intriguing, provided absolutely no help to the team.</li>
  <li>Finally, perhaps the most compelling evidence of all: On September 8th, 1522, the ship of Ferdinand Magellan “circumnavigated” the world, “proving” that the Earth is round. It goes without saying that this must have been an Opposite Day.</li>
  <li>The fifth of November also showed up in the dataset, but nobody could remember, remember why it was there in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<p>And so, the scientists that made up the Hecrenews Science and Research team had their data. They just needed to make sense of it. Luckily, this part was easy. Dunnell simply grabbed his handy TI-84 and by the altogether quite magical powers of linear regression, they found the clue. According to the slope of said line, an Opposite Day would occur ever -0.29 days. What does this mean? Idk, but its probably one more of those certain essential questions. The r^2 value of the evaluation was a solid 0.023, so the findings are essentially indisputable.</p>

<p>And now we go to the present day. All the Hecrenews Science and Research Team has to show for themselves is this rather queer negative decimal, but at least we know when Opposite Day is. The world can rest at last, and judges can finally absolve poor Mr. Heinreich Pickleblower without fear. All thanks to the Hecrenews, of course.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, that’s enough for one article. The mystery of Opposite Day has been quelled, all misconceptions expelled, and this word’s been mispslelld. Such are the goals of as illustrious of a news source as the Hecrenews. Now, you may have noticed that this article’s been a bit shorter than those prior. Well, the boss rolled out his idea of a game-changing reform: thrice-daily articles. So article length involuntarily goes down to compensate. Hope Hecrenews Article Quality Control (HAC) doesn’t flag me on this. Still, this is gonna be a doozy. I guess that upcoming feud with that up-and-coming news website will provide more than enough content. Till then, Wopps out.</p>

    <title>Billa: The Rise and Fall of an Underground School Organization</title>

    <description>An article about Billa: The Rise and Fall of an Underground School Organization</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What’s popping my guys, I am bacc! I know the boss promised to pay more if I posted daily articles but I could not manage. I also started my own blog which I am
gonna shamlessly plug (always remember the boss doesn’t pay that much) right <a href="https://mistermjir.github.io/">here</a>. Anywho, the boss said we are going to have to
lock horns with another up and coming news website. Apparently I cannot reveal that yet and it’s supposed to be speculation, but it seems big and rumor is going
around that this is a request from the super higher-ups, the HBA, and that’s pretty serious. Enough of my return, let’s get popping with the latest scoop.</p>

<p>Leafblower Elementary is your typical Elementary school, but on the inside it’s a special world. People like Carl Mugabe are working hard to improve the school and
the vast history of the school is yet to be revealed. Wopps Minor has promised more articles but we have yet to see them, unfortunately I had to take this scoop
from him because it was just too curious to be left alone.</p>

<p>Billa is what most call a bright kid. The teacher’s love him, he is engaged during class and even helps his struggling classmates. He always asks high-level questions
and is amazing at grades and sports and has many friends too. Basically Billa was who you wanted to be in school. But, there was more to this bright kid than meets the
eye, for Billa was also the head honcho of a huge backdoor scheme, the underground school organization known as <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>. Oh, guess we will call it GUSO, for
Generic Underground School Organization. As bright as Billa was, he was given an induction test to the number one undergound school organization of which we cannot
reveal or else they will be out to get us. It was a google form but it was a very difficult one. There were many sub sections and keys had to be obtained from each
of the subsections and one wrong move and the whole thing would have to be redone with slightly different questions. Billa, the genius of Leafblower Elementary, failed
the induction form. Billa was devastated, he was the number one in the school but still failed.</p>

<p>Things spiraled downhill from there. Upon hearing Billa’s failure, Billa’s girlfriend broke up with him, Billa sat alone at lunch during that day and no one came to
help him. He didn’t take the bus home and took the long walk, but this was his worst mistake. Along the way home Billa encountered a Plain Snaxe. Now if you’ve read
our HBA approved <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/01/snaxing-guide.html">Snaxing guide</a> you know all the hip tips and tricks, but Billa, an
Elementary schooler, was not a boomer and didn’t read the news, so he knew nothing about Snaxe safety. The snaxe in question was very persuasive and convinced Billa
he would recieve power but in exchange he would need to have an undergound school organization under the power of the Snaxii, that was how Billa would get his power.</p>

<p>Recruiting members in an undergound school organization seems impossible, but during lunch time with a little bit of intimidation, anything is possible. Billa seeked
the highest caliber of students, including Daredevil Jack, and recruited them into his league. For a few months Billa’s organization was the 2nd biggest and 2nd
most powerful in the school, but Billa’s reign would soon end. Although Billa got to power and was so close to reaching the biggest and strongest undergound school
organization, he made his mistake on day one. Billa should have never trusted that snaxe. The HBA sniffed him out, they sensed a strong snaxe precense and took out
the organization. Billa was so close to greatness, he was almost the number one undergound gang leader in the school, but everything went to ruin because he trusted
a snaxe. Billa had learned his lesson, now all he can say is, “My name is Billa” in a said voice, almost crying everytime.</p>

<p>Power in school is easy to shift. When choosing the underground school organization you want to join, make sure it has a solid, clean foundation, snaxe-free of course
and look not for the best one, but the most adamant one. But really, it all comes down to which underground school organization you want to join and what’s the best
for you. Underground school organizations are very caring of their members, and they are a great group to join and can help prepare a young child for the real world.
Just remember to read the Hecrenews and trust the HBA so you don’t make a mistake like Billa.</p>

    <title>One Man to take Revenge on Deserts for Enormous Weight Gain</title>

    <description>An article about One Man to take Revenge on Deserts for Enormous Weight Gain</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What drives you? The prospect of becoming a better person? Finally being inducted into the HBA? Being able to afford <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/03/music-group-recieves-backlash-on-song-delay.html">ARMD’s new album</a>? For one man, every waking moment is filled with one thought: revenge. Area dyude Bert Bulstrode (no relation to notable hecrenews correspondent Adalbert Bulstrode, despite making an appearance in a prior <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/24/local-sports-team-loses-faith-in-humanity-after-name-selection-competition.html">hecrenews article</a> himself) has taken it upon himself to rid the desert of that which it holds most dear: sand. Armed with only multiple boatloads of stone shovels, Bert Bulstrode will stop at nothing to make the cruel desert pay.</p>

<p>But pay for what, exactly? Hecrenews’s own BananaTheHuman was sent to that very desert to find out more Bulstrode and his motives. (Banana wasn’t able to cover the story himself; he needed to attend to some pear-related business. ‘Nuff said.) In the blinding sun of an unnamed desert, Bulstrode sets about his daily tasks. He was so kind as to provide Banana with an itinerary, shown below:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/bert_bulstrode_schedule.JPG" alt="" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><em>Bulstrode claims varying wake-up times stimulate him to push himself and dig up more desert. Of course, since he’s digging before he wakes up, while he wakes up, and after he wakes up anyways, we at the Hecrenews think this is a load of hooey.</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For the past week or so, Bert Bulstrode has been shoveling sand for 23 hours and 59 minutes each day (Bulstrode uses the remaining one minute to ferry the sand out of the gigantic hole he’s made and into an even more gigantic quite-literal mountain of sand, which other sometimes carry it away for whatever their needs require. Truly channeling the spirit of <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/20/man-takes-initiative-during-social-distancing-ends-up-with-every-job.html">Fred Dome</a>, who is now the lead of Hecrenews Article Quality Control (referred to as HAC, because everybody knows there’s no quality in these things), among half a million other titles. How he is able to keep this quite impressive work schedule up remains a mystery.</p>

<p>When asked about his motive, Bert launched into a truly woeful tale (while still maintaining his digging efforts). Bert had always been something of a health freak, but a week and a half ago, be decided to splurge on a $66.95 cheesecake, the epitome of decadence. With a diameter of 13.5 inches, it truly was a beast of a cheesecake. Lemon-flavoured goodness, right there. Yum. Oh shoot, back to the article at hand. However, due to the distancing protocols put in place, Bulstrode was forced to celebrate his birthday by himself, and that included eating the monster cheesecake by himself. “It don’t make good sense to throw it away”, Bert said when questioned. So, with all the passion and dogged perseverance he put into getting a spankin’ body, Bert sat down to eat. And eat he did. For 2 days, Bert did nothing but eat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I shoveled nothing but cheesecake in m’mouth, and did nothing but shsovel cheesecake in m’mouth. And I sure did pay for it. But now instead of shoveling cheesecake, I’m shoveling sand. That’s right, shoveling sand to take revenge.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After Bert’s attempt to get his money’s worth from the giant cheesecake, the quantity of cheesecake had severely diminished. The opposite could be said about Bulstrode’s BMI. Oh, what a calamity! Rendered almost immobile by the vast quantities of cheesecake within him, Bulstrode sulked for at least a day or two. Then he knew. Bulstrode would take revenge on the cheesecake, and all other foods like it! In his own words, he would “Go all Alt + F4 on those suckas”.</p>

<p><em>It seems prudent at this point to note Bulstrode’s frankly quite horrible typing skills. Bert sadly never took iExplore, and there was no way he could learn to type effectiveely without taking this very much crucial class. Very sad, rops.</em></p>

<p>Bulstrode quickly hopped onto the nearest search engine (not Bing, for obvious reasons) and searched the following:
<img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/bert_bulstrode_search.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This led him to an unknown desert, where Bert got to work. He called up his local shovel dealer, and within an hour, was shoveling away. Shoveling, not just for himself, but for all formerly fit people forced to not let fattening foods go to waste and therefore reduced to a very unpleasant state.</p>

<p>This brings us back to the present day. Bulstrode has dug up nearly 1/9th of the desert, and is currently unsure about what to do with the massive quantities of sand he’s acucmulated. “I dunno, go desertify up some hapless rainforst for all I care”, says Bert. Aside from the sand, Bert has uncovered various sunken treasures. They reveal the vast history of this desert, ranging from rudimentary tools to a highly suspicious underground bunker. The most curious find, however, is nothing but a single, deadly-seeming fang. This has been sent to the Hecrenews Research and Analysis team for further information. Maybe we’ll soon be enlightened with the meaning of this discovery.</p>

<p>But for now, Bulstrode digs. And digs. And digs some more. Wopps out.</p>

    <description>An article about Very Dear Friends of Local Man Astonished at Will to Live</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent news, two very dear friends of local dyude John Orblong have expressed their complete and utter bafflement at Orblong’s will to live. According to Robald and Jonas Shickner, John’s dogged determination to stay conscious, keep breathing, maintain homeostasis, etc. is “most frustrating”. The brothers Shickner gave an excluside interview to Hecrenews interviewer Biggin Mammo in order to vent these frustrations:</p>

<p><em>Robald and Jonas Shickner enter, wearing black clothing, ski masks, and gloves</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Well, hello. Are you two gentlemen here for the interview we had scheduled or to rob me senseless? I honestly can’t tell.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “Um, yes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Biggin Mammo visibly relaxes, then looks confused, then tenses up again</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “So, let’s introduce you. I have here with me the two brothers Shickner, who are very dear friends with John Orblong, the subject of this story.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “I know that.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “I was talking to the readers, Shickner #1. Assuming there are any, of course.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “Why is he Shickner #1?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Anyways, let’s get to the nutty grutty of this conversation. My loyal army of informants tell me you’re frustrated. Why?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “<em>We</em> heard the Hecrenews had a <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/01/hecrenews-authors-experiencing-dearth-of-dirt.html">dearth of dirt</a>. So <em>we</em> informed you of this to vent some of our frustrations. To publicize this tragedy a little bit.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “And what tragedy would that be?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “Well, John Orblong, that notoious do-gooder that he is, just has an extremely above average will to live. And my brother and I find that very frustrating.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “As Shickner #1, I can affirm that we find this very frustrating.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “Why is <em>he</em> Shickner #1?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “I see. Do you have any evidence of Orblong’s very very high willingness to not kick the good ol’ bucket?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Jonas Shickner produces a manilla file folder from somewhere within the depths of his criminal getup, and pulls some pictures out</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “So this is John Orblong. A writer, lives next door to the bank, has a basement with a not-so-thick wall. Not the house-selling type though.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “A bit lacking in the hair department.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “So is your name.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Wow, that’s a lot of very personal information. Are yinz good friends with Mr. Orblong?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “Er, we know him <em>very</em> well.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “What my poor, misguided brother means to say is that we hve a very good relationship with Mr. Orblong. However, John sometimes forgets things real easy. So he won’t remember us too well. But don’t ever ask him about his memory loss.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Why?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “Because he forgot he has it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “I see. Thank you for clarifying, Shickner #1.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “<em>Why</em> is he Shickner #1?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “I hear that John Orblong has survived some very life-threatening events recently. Could you elaborate on this?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “Well, last tuesday, John was mugged by two brothers, one considerably more attractive than the other. W– Sorry. <em>They</em> wanted the deed to Orblong’s property, but for some reason Orblong wasn’t carrying the deed on his person.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “Last Wednesday, Orblong ran into two figures at the County Legal Office trying to slide their way into John Orblong’s last will and testament as his sole heirs. Their names were–”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “Never mind what their names were.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “As you will it, Shickner #1”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “Why is he Shickner #<em>1</em>?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “The crux of the story is that after Orblong saw those two figures, he somehow ended up tied to a set of railway tracks.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “That’s quite a big jump, from the county office to a set of railway tracks.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “Sure is.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>At that precise moment, hecrenews intern Eif al-Tawa walks into the room, holding a tray of coffees.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Al-Tawa: “It’s okay, you don’t have to hide it. I’ve wanted to off somebody for a long time too, but only got him in a hospital, <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/20/writing-in-all-caps-found-to-be-more-persuasive.html">suing the hecc out of the Hecrenews</a>. Wish you the best of luck trying to get that sweet, sweet bank money, he he he.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Coffee boy, your job is to give me the coffee. Let me handle the interviewing; I’m an experienced interviewer and you lack the required girth to even conduct one.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Al-Tawa: “Fine.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Eif al-Tawa hands all three cups of coffee to Biggin Mammo, then exits</em></p>

<p><em>Biggin Mammo takes a sip of the coffee and promptly spits it out, then expertly throws the remaining two coffee cups into a trash can in the corner of the room</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Gosh darn intern keeps putting rosemary or something in my coffee to spite me, I’m going to have a talk with him after <del>school</del> this is over. Anyways, what became of Orblong on the rails, Shickner #1?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “For the last time, Why is he Shickner #1?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Foolboy, I ask the questions around here. Sit down or I’ll have a talk with <em>you</em> after <del>school</del> this is over as well.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Robald Shickner sits down</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “So, apparently the trains weren’t even running that day! Can you believe it?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Wow, what a lucky break!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “No, you don’t get it. The two people that planned the whole tying-Orblong-to-the-railway-tracks idea put a lot of thought and effort into their idea. It’s incredibly frustrating when something last minute like an unfinagled boiler comes up and wrecks a plan like that.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “I… see.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “So, on to Orblong’s next even more agonizing escape from certain doom.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “On Friday, Orblong was shopping for some kitchen appliances. I think he finally got the idea to move out, what with all his near misses and everything.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robld: “Plus the sign two people spray painted to his window saying ‘Move out plz’”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “Yes, that too. So, Orblong was strolling down Clanton Avenue when he saw a store advertising a walk-in microwave!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “To be honest, it wasn’t much of a store. More like a little haphazard shack that looked like it could have been built by two brothers only hours after they heard of a certain individual’s interest in–”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “Can it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: Uh-huh. Tell me more, tell me more. This is one good story right here!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “As Shickner #1–”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Robald Shickner makes a mean face, then abruptly stops when Jonas Shickner makes a much meaner face</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “As I was saying, as Shickner #1, I’ll continue the story you’re enjoying so much. John Orblong was very interested by the walk-in microwave, so he predictably walked inside it. He didn’t at all notice two skulking shadows in the background. Said two skulking shadows closed the door as soon as Orblong walked in, and hit the Reheat button. But, to their horrified surprise, <em>somebody</em> forgot to plug the microwave in!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Jonas Shickner casts an even meaner look than before at Robald Shickner, who promptly withers away inside</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “So Orblong just walked out, free to antagonize a couple would-be murderers another day. That was when the two skulking shadows realized they needed professional help.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “That brings us to yesterday. During a jog in a nearby park, John Orblong was jumped by a pack of street cats, and was this close to being mauled so severaly that hewould have no choice but to vacate his hoouse and go see an ICU.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “But– and there always seems to be a but in the story of these two shadowy figures– the hired cats mysteriously didn’t do any damage. What a waste of $42.50.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “Turns out that while John Orblong doesn’t carry the deed to his property on his person when going out, he does carry several cans of catnip. Who would have thought? The cats were made completely harmless, and Orblong walked away unmutilated. Deeply confused and perhaps a bit scared, but unmutilated.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “This was the last straw. Don’t you see how incredibly frustrating it is? Hours and hours upon hours of planning, stakeouts, and walk-in microwave construction by that most sinister duo, all for nothing! John Orblong has no respect for good ol’ plotting!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Yes, the miraculous escape of a local dyude from many dangers is a very bad and frustrating occurrence.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “Exactly.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “The whole situation ended up catastrophically. People’s hard earned money is still safe in the bank, John Orblong’s basement has no gaping hole in it, and Orblong himself is happily gallivanting across the suburban landscape of this oh-so-horrible city.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “At least there’s lasting psychological damage.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “Of couse, how could I have ever forgotten that?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “Because you’re not Shickner #1.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Wow, wow, very enlightening. Just one question. How exactly do you two know all this? It’s just that the Boss has been getting somewhat frantic about citing our sources recently.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jonas: “Umm”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robald: “Umm”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Al-Tawa: “Umm”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Hey, where’s that intern’s voice coming from!?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Al-Tawa: “I dunno.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mammo: “Wait a minute, the only way you could know so much about those two murderous figures is if you were those two murderous figures. Oh, oh no.. Nooooo!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And with that, the interview ended. In addition to our mounting mountain of legal battles, the Hecrenews now faces the costs to repair a broken window in the interview room and a broken mind in the body of loyal Biggin Mammo, who was so shaken by the relevation of the criminals’ identities that he fell into a comma. Must’ve been a pretty dangerous comma, too. Like that one. That one seems pretty dangerous to me, but who am I to judge? Mandatory mininmum word count passed, story told, article title all SEO’d up, I’d say this article’s done and dusted. Wopps Minor, signing off.</p>

    <title>(Florida) Man Sneezes Too Hard on Plane, Discovers New Form of Propulsion</title>

    <description>An article about (Florida) Man Sneezes Too Hard on Plane, Discovers New Form of Propulsion</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know what, the boss said I had to try something different. Not my usual 1st person view style, but your classic 3rd person definitely not objective Hecrenews style. I guess why not.</p>

<p>The boss also wanted me to put in a plugin for a Hecrenews survey. Take it if you want(or not, just know that if you don’t my pay gets lowered). Here’s the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqNyv78wKmscTj3j9Hf00FI9UGFT-zjVRnm-uBriXPvCUIFw/viewform?usp=sf_link">survey</a>.</p>

<p>Ok. Shutting down 1st person, booting up 3rd person. This is going to be a ruff ride.</p>

<p>A new breakthrough in the Space Race! Aaaaand I give up. This 3rd person thing is kind of hard.</p>

<p>The boss had sent me to Florida. Great, the land of ripoff Californians and namesake men. Though, to be fair, they do have an awesome plethora of overpriced theme parks(I hear the H-Bird is planning on opening a park in Florida too). I had an interview scheduled with Ki Lhaim(pronounced Lie-m), the man responsible for this breakthrough.</p>

<p>As I stepped through the Hawaiian Themed Resort(in Florida, god, these people), I was greeted by friendly neon humanoids, possibly an alien species. Forgetting that I had an interview to do, I immediately started chatting up the nearest one, a male? specimen by the name of Ralph. Turns out these beings lived in Florida, and have been around for quite a long time. Before I could press on and uncover the truth behind aliens, a large round object hit me in the back of the head.</p>

<p>Yes, a UFO! I thought. I turned around, albeit kind of groggily, for I had just been smacked in the head, and found a bright purple frisbee. Gosh darn it.</p>

<p>“Hey sir, are you…. Banana the Human?” A voice called.</p>

<p>I <del>whipped</del> wopped to the source of the sound. It was a short, bearded man, with a friendly smile and whatnot descriptions(don’t judge, it’s not like I write for a living).</p>

<p>“Why yes, yes I am. Are you Ki Lhaim, my dude?”</p>

<p>“You betcha. Come on, let’s get this interview thing started”</p>

<p>We headed to the customary so-so restaurant all resorts have, ordered some fries with a side of burnt shrimp tails, and proceeded to talk.</p>

<p>“So, mmmm, what a beat, this food is so good. Sorry, I just have a problem whenever burnt shrimp tails are around,” Ki mumbed through the ginormous mouthfuls he was force-feeding down his gullet.</p>

<p>“No, problem, quite understandable”, I said, surprising myself with my politeness. “Can we get to the deets of the feats that supposedly went down on one of the air fleets?”</p>

<p>“Alright. It was really weird. I was aboard one of those air-birds, you know, the ones with those nonmoving wings.”</p>

<p>“You mean, airplanes?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yeah, air-pains. Well anyway, we were up in the sky, zooming to Chattanooga, and I was getting really excited. You see, I was going to meet the Roller, the most gangsta gangsta, well you know. He’s awesome. And I got so hyped up I sneezed. And then all heck(retary bird) broke loose.”</p>

<p>“Wait a second, you got hyped up and sneezed. How does that even work?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Banana, I’m no ornithologist. Anyway, as soon as I sneezed, the plane lurched back, and before anyone could shout “That’s a big achoo siree”, we were back in Florida.”</p>

<p>Intrigued, I pressed on for more information(this sentence was probably not needed, but as Wopps probably told you, we have a minimum word count that needs to be met or else the boss only pays us for 1 meal a day).</p>

<p>“Banana, that’s when the scientists came in. They took me to a special lab-type thing, and forced me into a little space capsule. As soon as I was inside, they sprayed pepper spray everywhere. Now you know pepper spray, it makes you sneeze real good. Before I knew it, I was aboard the space station.”</p>

<p>“And what’s next for this new form of propulsion, eh”, I asked, a little more Canadian than usual.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been getting calls from all the big erasers up there in the aviation world. The Left bros, The Intergalactic Pseudo-Empire, but I’ve decided on Melon Tusk, that man’s a cool dude.”</p>

<p>At the mention of Melon Tusk, I got repulsed. The man and I had some history I would rather not go into. He’s brilliant of course, but he and I had some beef one day, and let’s just say he’s vegetarian now. I decided to end this interview before I started overturning tables and throwing up chandeliers.</p>

<p>“Allright Ki, thanks for your time, my dude. Wish you the best of luck with Tusk, man, and may the H-Bird bless you and whatnot” I said, and got up to leave.</p>

<p>“But, what about my pay, Banana. I was told that Hecrenews pays its interviewees.”</p>

<p>“Nah, that’s probably some Snaxe propaganda, but if its a real problem, just call our customer service number”</p>

<p>“Oh okay Banana, will do”</p>

<p>Before he could realize we don’t have a customer service number of a customer service department(what do you think, there are only 3 writers and one fool leading us), I quickly left the building, got out of Florida, and headed back to HQ.</p>

<p>And that’s pretty much it. Lesson of the story is, if you wanna go fast, you gotta give up some snot. Maybe I should quit this job and become a motivational speaker(Bluetooth or Plug-In, that is the question).</p>

    <description>An article about Secret to Silky Smooth Hair</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What’s popping peoples, I have returned from the unknown. Dang it’s been a while since I posted my last report so I’m not sure if I remembered how to do this but the
boss is forcing me to do it, no matter if I know it or not.</p>

<p>I was at the saloon the other day, obviously keeping the 6 feet distancing and the very fancy, comfortable, and 100% breathable masks on. You may have heard of a
‘wax on, wax off’ but for our protection it’s just ‘mask on.’ Anywho, I was trying out a new hair style for not particular reason, you gotta switch it up every now and
then. Hopefully I recieve positives reviews from Wopps and Banana and the other guy- Fred Dome I think? He’s the one who has every job. I’ve noticed that this isn’t
even article format but I ain’t gonna stop now. I was recently binge-watching some movies (before my disappearance, don’t think I would disappear for such a silly
reason) and I saw some wild hair styles. Unfortunately Hollywood hair styles were too bland for my tastes, this is where I turned to Bollywood. With India banning
Tik-Tok and other Chinese apps, it was about time to hop into the bandwagon so I started watching some Bollywood movies (with no knowledge on how to speak Indian,
luckilly there are closed captions in English which I can digest more easily).</p>

<p>“That was the one.” I knew it when I saw it. That hairstyle, I knew it was it.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/amitabh_bachchan_hairstyle.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Just a massive lump of hair showing domiance but still retaining shape, I needed it so I drove over to the local saloon. The experience was great but this article
was not supposed to be about me. TUrns out my man Cromwell was also chilling the saloon getting a fresh new cut to match his fresh new kicks. “Dyude!” I said, shocked.
“Is that really your hair? It’s so smooth. Unbelievable, I finally have good article content, er, ignore that. Anywho, how did you get your hair that silky smooth.
This is amazing! Did you use the shampoo in the commercials? Are you a shampoo model yourself?” Cromwell literally had the silkiest and smoothest hair in existence.
It was very nice, I finally understood the concept of ‘eye-candy’ but this was more like an ‘eye-meal,’ nay, an ‘eye-buffet!’ “It’s really simple-“ “Wait, are you
sure you can reveal this information to me and the public?” “What? Why should I keep this wonderful trick to myself? The world would be a better place if we could all
have such silky smooth hair like mine. I’ll tell you, and you better put this in your article. Every year for Christmas I ask for a year’s supply of Jolly Juice. It’s
a magical item crafted for Santa Claus himself. Jolly Juice can do it all. I’m not kidding. Literally everything, Jolly Juice can do it.”</p>

<p>Image of Jolly Juice:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/jolly-juice.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>“So what do you do, drink it?” I asked. “No silly, you use a small quantity as shampoo. You can drink the rest for the day, it tastes amazing, it is the most beautiful
thing to every grace man’s tastebuds.” “Dang, but the Easter Bunny told me Santa wasn’t real.” “Nah, he’s real alright.” “Ok, guess I’m gonna wish me some Jolly
Juice!” “There’s one catch though,” said Cromwell, “You must be on the nice list, you will not get any Jolly Juice if you’re on the naughty list.” “Well, anyone
would be on the nice list to obtain hair as silky smooth as you, Cromwell.” The saloon workers were listening in as they also wanted some silky smooth hair.</p>

<p>Well, if you want out-of-this-world silky smooth hair, just ask your local Santa Claus for some Jolly Juice. That’s it for me, see you next time!</p>

    <title>Ring of Propaganda Bandits Post Defamatory Snaxe Propaganda</title>

    <description>An article about Ring of Propaganda Bandits Post Defamatory Snaxe Propaganda</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent news, a suspicious gang has been terrorizing the city for the past couple weeks. Known only as the “Propaganda People”, this band of hooligans (not the good kind) has risen to infamy for posting snaxe propaganda all over town. The Propaganda People are a new gang, most likely intending to establish their place as the city’s #1 snaxe-follower cult. They’ve attempted to accomplish this by posting two varieties of snaxe propaganda all over town. In the library? Snaxe propaganda. At a Florida #$!$!@#$%#@-ers game? Snaxe propaganda. In an airport bathroom? You guessed it, snaxe propaganda. For the HBA, this was nothing short of a public relations disaster, but the good folks over at the HBA’s propaganda control division were so kind as so hand a specimen of each type of snaxe propaganda to the Hecrenews Research and Research team for further analysis.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: If you are weak-willed in any way, shape, or form, LOOK AWAY IMMEDIATELY. This is REAL Snaxe Propaganda. Aside from its horrendous grammar, it is famous for being eerily persuasive. DO NOT be swayed by what you are about to see. If it helps, chant “Bird-dog good, Cat-snake bad” repeatedly.</strong></p>

<p>This first bit of snaxe propaganda – <strong>WARNING: Don’t look too close, or you’ll be converted to their side. Never underestimate the persuasive prowess of the Yiper.</strong> – is believed to be penned by the Yiper itself. Dating back to the Hecretarian Revolution/Snaxely Uprising, this model of propaganda was last seen hung up by a “Skulking Shadow” in the town of Snaskatoon. It was very dangerous stuff, even during that archaic time. Threatening to convert a group of innocent townspeople, it took every rhetorical device in a local Narrator’s briefcase to persuade them (after a fair bit of roasting) to not heed the propaganda, and instead take the fight to the snaxii, where the conniving snaxii wouldn’t be able to use their words. This led to the famed Battle of Snaxington, as you well know. A similar incident happened in the nearby town of Conbird, and these two incidents helped spark the Revolution.</p>

<p>Historical jibber-jabber aside, what that statement attempted to demonstrate was just how deadly this propaganda can be. Hecrenews investigative reporter Fred Dome had the pleasure of interviewing passerby near the hookah lounge. Below are some of their all-too-unsettling responses. We need to stop this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“the most beautiful work of art I’ve ever set my eyes on.”</em> - Margarine Lemonrind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, Mrs. Lemonrind was under the poster’s spell at the time of uttering this quote, as no sane person would call this monstrosity <em>art</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Well, pilfer m’kneecaps and feed me to vegans, ain’t that the most compelling liddl’ pitcher you ever saw!”</em> - Usnavi</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Thisssss piece isss quite ssssplendid”</em> - “Unknown figure, prone to meowing, slithering, and acting very snaxely in general</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Yooo, that’s some pretty stankin’ fine propaganda”</em> - Very shady character who’s only distinguishing feature was a permanently arched eyebrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These public reactions are quite alarming, for sure, but take into consideration that this wasn’t the only piece of propaganda spread by the gang.

| <em>The second piece of dreaded snaxe porpaganda sent to us by the good old Hecrenews kooky sciencey people</em> |</p>

<p>The second poster, which seems to be the Propaganda People’s own creation, was posted on a sign carried by someone named <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/20/writing-in-all-caps-found-to-be-more-persuasive.html">Blat Beck</a>, all without him, or insidious intern Eif al-Tawa following him, realizing it. Beck carried the propaganda around for many long hours, which may have contributed to his horribly beaten state at the end of that day. Luckily, while Beck was in the hospital recovering from his numerous injuries (The fact that Beck was in the hospital in the first place was decidedly <em>not</em> lucky– (remember, we do still have an ongoing lawsuit, best not to give the prosecution any more evidence of employee negligence)).</p>

<p>The second piece of propaganda, much like the first, is visually, spiritually, mentally, and even dentally disturbing. It depicts a snaxe presiding over the somewhat-flatter-than-normal earth, ruling with an <del>iron fist</del>  gentle touch. It goes without saying that you, dear reader of the hecrenews, should stay far, far away from this one as well. In fact, it may be prudent to scream and run in the other direction whenever you see a flat Earth.</p>

<p>That’s all for now, dear Hecrenews reader. (Oh, how I hope there’s at least one of you!) Stay strong and be wary. The Propaganda People may yet strike again, but if they do, the Hecrenews will be right there to cover the incident! (After a healthy week-lonng bout of procrastination, of course).</p>

    <title>Remembering the Famed Zulu Trial: A Hecrenews Retrospective</title>

    <description>An article about Remembering the Famed Zulu Trial: A Hecrenews Retrospective</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While it seems like ancient history, the first trial that HBA ever conducted, the famous (or infamous) Zulu trial took place about 2.5 years ago. While it’s generally agreed that this trial was a disorganized catasrophe on all counts, like every HBA trial, there is still much to be learned from it– namely, how to NOT conduct a trial <em>(the HBA decidedly has not learned anything from the Zulu trial to date)</em>.</p>

<p>I had the privelege of being prosecuted during this defining moment of the HBA. Also referred to as <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> vs. HBA, the trial was a momentous ocassioun, held in the esteemed Lunchroom Court. In front of honorable judge <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, the prosecution, headed by <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, first laid out the facts of the case. <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, a <del>trusted</del> <em>(very prominent)</em> member of the HBA, had recently <del>defiled</del> <em>(slightly edited)</em> a holy document compiling all the evidence of the Hecretary Birds and Snaxii into a report. Oh, and <del>defiled</del> <em>(modified)</em> it he had! The entire document was converted into Zulu. Why zulu, as well as the motives for this <del>heinous</del> <em>(very reasonable)</em> crime, has never been determined to date.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The trial was increadibly chaotic, as all HBA trials were. It set an important precedent that the landmark Treason Trial followed in full. During the trial, nobody was really sure of their part, and there was absolutely no organization whatsoever. Several jury members were, in fact, unable to be present at the proceedings, as they were held captive at the time by a mysterious entity known only as Lun Schline. The others fared little better. At least the Zulu trial was worlds better than the Treason Trial, in which the defendant, <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, somehow was acquitted with absolutely no evidence and for no reason at all, while the prosecution had solid <em>(even if untrue)</em> evidence of treasonous activities. In addition, that very same <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> ended up changing the focus of the trial so that another member was tried, and escaped completely. I suspect backroom deals.</p>

<p>Going back to the trial I’m not getting paid enough to cover <em>(@boss: hint hint)</em>, the judge and jury, made up exclusively of members of the HBA, ruled in favor of the HBA <em>(Of course they did)</em>. <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> was <em>(un)</em>justly sentenced to a week-long suspension from all HBA-related activities. Legend has it <em>(but what do I know if it’s true or not?)</em> that his brainwaves were constantly monitored for the slightest thought of birds, organizations, or even the letter H.</p>

<p>All in all, this was a very important trial, and has an important place in HBA legal history as the first trial that the HBA presided over <em>(Cases that the HBA did not preside over, as a rule, generally went much more smoothly, sich as Snaxely v. Birduson and Storkbury v. Pebbleson.)</em></p>

<p>Ah, shoot. The boss set us on a minimum word limit again, to “improve article quality”. Personally, I think that this is pretty unecessary, considering <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/21/persuasive-article.html">this newly published and extremely compelling article</a>. But then again, that wonderful piece of rhetoric does have quite an impressive character count, so maybe the boss is right. Eh, I don’t know.</p>

<p>What I do know is that whatever the article above was talking about, it was definitely good stuff. Very good. Superb. Yep, practically spotless. Oh, I could keep praising myself for a good long bit more, but I see that minimum word requirement coming up like the ribbon across a finish line. So…close. And you already know I’m not going to write a single word past it.
Dang it, seven words under. What ever shall I do?
Double dang it, three words over. This actually sucks.</p>

<p>Ah well, that’ll be it for me. No sense in dragging an article that I’ve been dragging out for the last couple paragraphs any further. The end.</p>

    <description>An article about Writing in all caps found to be 150% more persuasive</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hecrenews Science and Research team is back again with another most interesting finding. In order to get to the root of persuasive editorial creation (coming soon to a hecrenews near you!), we measured the effects of various text formatting schemes on persuasive skills, and audience response in general. The highly esteemed Sheeple Dunell, official smartypants of the Science and Research team, presided over the investigation. In an excerpt from the upcoming paper on the findings, Dunnell describes the experimental setup:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The experiment was conducted by varying the size, capitalization, message, and colors of the text on a large poster board. Hecrenews’s very own Blat Beck volunteered to hold the sign, letting passerby view the sign and react to it. We elected to thrust Blat into the midst of some random protest each time we conducted a trial, to make the sign seem more in place. The good thing is, there were lots of these protests, so we could practically just push Beck into one, record a couple reactions, then walk a block or two until we found the next one (find out why the people are in uproar soon!). I give it a 10/10, very easy process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a control for the experiment, Dunnell and his team decided to have Beck tote around a very dry sign, with lots of body text and an actual link that people would have to fill out instead of a QR code. When asked why this obviously extreme sign should be used as a control, Dunnell said “E = mc^2, and Newton weighed more than Bohr.” The control setup is pictured below:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/caps_lock9.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>This sign received mixed reactions. Some passerby were observed to be furiously tap-tapping away on their mobile devices (although it’s uncertain as to whether this was caused by the link on the sign, or if people are generally attracted to their phones), while others visibly recoiled from the wordy text and gave poor Beck a wide berth. Noting down the civilian response, Dunnell and his team made slight adjustments to the design.</p>

<p>Their next setup is pictured below. Instead of a wordy message, the team decided to try a quick, memorable call to action. The first trial using this statement was in lowercase. The team thought that since they weren’t capping any of the letters, the pedestrians would heed their honest, clear command.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/caps_lock5.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Tragically, this message had almost a null result. Only one pedestrian even showed any notice to Blat Beck, and that was only to tell him to “shove off, you’re in my way”, at the unidentified pedestrian attempted to cross a street and found his path blocked by a protest, with Beck being the closest individual.</p>

<p>Resolving to try and make the message stand out more, the team decided to capitalize one letter at random, resulting in the below format. Completely by accident, the bumbling fools we feel ashamed to call researches had written the message in camel case. Their hypothesis for the bystander interaction with this sign was that “the side-people, they’re all too lazy to read all lowercase letters, so they’ll skip to the second word, and recognize lil’ Beck, even if they don’t do any kicking. Soon, Blat Beck will get what he deserves. Soon…”, according to Science and Research intern Eif al-Tawa.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/caps_lock6.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>The result was more or less identical to the hypothesized outcome, but with slightly less definite reactions. A middle-aged white lady holding a pack of M&amp;M’s did look at Beck, but only through a passing glance, as did her poodle.</p>

<p>Dunnell had no choice but to try and get even more persuasive. To attract even more attention. He chose a tried-and-true method: ALL CAPS. The larger the letters, the better the engagement, and the higher the persuasion, the team believed.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/caps_lock4.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>And it turns out, that for one time in their career, the researchers were right. The fully capitalized sign attracted lots more attention. One or two of the passerby even gave Beck a kick, demonstrating just how great the persuasive power of the method was. However, this good news came with a caveat, as even now, the researchers are trying to determine whether Eif al-Tawa bribing the two men to kick Beck “good and proper” was a significant interruption to the experiment. While a portion of the team occupied themselves with that, the rest strode on.</p>

<p>For no apparent reason whatsoever, the team then decided to format the message in a way that resembled the formatting used for Hecrenews images.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/caps_lock7.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>The result was positive, if confusedly so. A few “people” began walking mechanically towards Beck and proceeded to kick him, one time each. Then they left. Beck, with a smarting backside, said that the situation was “real sus”.</p>

<p>The next design visited was a rather colorful one. Thinking that the bystanders would have grown bored of plain, black letters on cardboard, the research team decided to spice it up a bit and give each letter its own unique color. Hours were spent selecting just the right mix of colors to be extra persuasive, resulting in the image below:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/caps_lock8.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most people gave Blat a wide berth, and one was noted saying “MY EYES! OOHHH THE YELLOW!..” The research team is unsure as to whether this is a complement or criticism of the design, as at least the person noticeed the sign.</p>

<p>The next design visited was also a rather colorful one. Figuring that nobody would be enticed by normal letters, Donnell tried symbols. To be precise, he ordered al-Tawa to mash a couple numbers while holding the shift key, resulting in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/caps_lock10.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>The only significant deviation from other trials was that an old man walked over to Beck and told him to “Mind [his] manners, mister”. The old man raised his cane as if to show Blat Beck he meant business (eliciting a whoop from Eif al-Tawa), but the situation was defused by a profuse apology on Beck’s part.</p>

<p>Donnell’s team dug hard to find another method of capitalization, and tHeY fInAlLy DeCiDeD oN tHiS mOnStRoSiTy:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/caps_lock1.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>The reactions were entirely inconclusive. Nobody reacted in an unusual way, except for a couple “memers” who gave Beck a wide berth. The team concluded that there wasn’t a soul that had the social intelligence to decipher the discombobulating mix of capitalized and uncapitalized letters.</p>

<p>Feeling slightly disheartened at the lack of violence, Eif al-Tawa started a motion to change the message for future trials. For “only scientific” reasons, Blat would now carry a sign with the most, derogatory, downright evil message possible. It pains me have these words stain a media type as holy as a Hecrenews Article, but here you go:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/caps_lock2.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>As soon as Beck got out of the shiny Hecrenews white van, the tension was palpable. Every single streetgoer, most of his fellow protesters, and most prominently, Eif al-Tawa gave him a murderous look, then started beating him left and right. In the fray, somebody shouted, “That’ll teach you for stealing my Yoo-hoo!”. In addition to various other wounds, Beck received a black eye and several tomatoes to the body. Beck wasn’t in good shape by the time the team intervened, and requested to have a break, or some financial compensation for his numerous injuries, or something.</p>

<p>But instead, those researchers, exhorted by al-Tawa, sent him out again, this time with an even more inflammatory text. Using what they had learned from previous trials, the researchers immediately sent Beck out with the same message, but this time with all caps and  puntuation at the end. The below image is how Beck looked immediately BEFORE going out, as the image after would have been too obscene to display on this article.</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/caps_lock3.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Blat Beck was completely fine and had a wonderful time, kappa. In reality, a lynch mob formed within seconds of Beck joining the protest and did what lynch mobs do best. Blat Beck was injured so severely, he had to be airlifted out of the situation. From a hospital bed in <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, Beck describes his ordeal: “As soon as I stepped out, it was a tangled sea of limbs and tomatoes…and knives? My memory of the day isn’t that great. It’s almost like the mob was rented beforehand and just pounced when… wait a minute.”</p>

<p>The Hecrenews is currently facing a lawsuit on this in addition to our other one (<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/11/as-robocalls-become-more-prominent-teens-fight-to-preserve-a-way-of-life.html">see here</a>). Updates on our swiftly sinking legal ship coming soon (Boy, we really will market anything as news).</p>

<p>Going back to the experiment, Sheeple Donnell published a preliminary report on the results, stating that “Caps Lock and multicolored seemed to be the most persuasive and least damaging, although random symbols have some merit and should be explored further”. So, whenever Hecrenews editorials come out, be sure to expect only the most persuasive of formatting. All caps, randomly colored, with a couple nonsense symbols thrown in. According to this study, this will resonate perfectly.</p>

    <title>Oxygen saves lives of Millions</title>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/06/19/oxygen-saves-lives-of-millions.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Oxygen saves lives of Millions</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although we believe many superheroes like spiderman, batman, and such to be unrealistic, our world does consist of real superheros. Oxygen is one of the superheros
working non-stop around the clock to make sure every human is alive. Hospitals around the globe have confirmed oxygen’s power to save lives. Dr Etenesh Katharina, who
works at a local hospital, testifies on behalf on the selfless deeds of oxygen. “Whenever out patients are delivering babies, oxygen is right there to allow them to
survive. Without oxygen, I would say most of the newborns only have about a minute to survive, it’s thanks to oxygen they’re able to live for about the life
expectancy for their area with few exceptions. I am really astonished by the work of oxygen. It’s just incredible. I can’t believe how oxygen is doing this all across
the world. Not only is oxygen prventing death, but is also allowing people like me to keep on living.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we were unable to schedule an interview with oxygen. The contact information is non-existent and we probably shouldn’t distrub oxygen while it works
non-stop around the clock saving lives all the time. However, we did find some ground-breaking information on this hero.</p>

<p>Oxygen comes from the plants. This is big. We do not know exactly how, speculators assume photosynthesis and stuff dealing with glucose, the light and dark cycle,
chlorophyll, but we cannnot trust speculators as we are a news site of high quality. Seeing the story in this light makes a heavy blow to vegetarians, as their habits
of eating plants are lowering the amount of oxygen- wait, what’s this? Breaking news?! That’s impossible. This just in, oxygen from plants is mainly derived from
the leaves, not all vegeterians are at fault. In fact, in the early times cyanobacteria was producing oxygen like mad before plants were even a thing. Cyanobacteria
has long since disappeared from the scene but it is just hiding, it hasn’t really gone anywhere.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, sometimes the superhero abilities of oxygen are suppressed thanks to human activity. Humans went big business and big factories during some event known
as the industrial revolution and boy did factories go big. Not only did factories get bigger, but more factories were made. These factories pump in human labor and
pump out all the latest and hot products, but also produce mad pollution as a consequence. The pollution dilutes the power of oxygen and renders it useless, as the
overpowering smoke causes people to cough and go sick. Nevertheless, many people were not too hot with these trends and many have joined movements to grow more plants,
or to put it properly, plant more plants. Local self-proclaimed green thumb Ellena Donelly keeps on appearing without being asked as she wants to get into the spotlight
but it’s very hard for us to find people to interview so our options are quite limited. “I’m no mathematician, but if we keep on growing plants, we will be directly
countering pollution.” “So it’s like a Yu-Gi-Oh! trap card?” “I have no idea what you just said, but I believe if we keep on working hard, we will be able to stop the
pollution.”</p>

<p>At this point I have no idea what this article is about. Oh, it’s about oxygen being a superhero. Make sure to be grateful to our heroes like oxygen, because society
would truly be a mess without them.</p>

    <title>Following an HBA Researcher</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/06/18/following-an-hba-researcher.html</link>

    <description>An article about Following an HBA Researcher</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I got the special opportunity to go on an expedition with a member of the HBA. The goal was to discover some new species. During the HBA’s peak
in 2018 many new species were being discovered left and right. The HBA cannot give a proper estimate on how many species they have discovered so far (as a percentage).
With the current manpower of the HBA, it is very hard for them to go on expeditions and discover new species. Another reason is the lack of energy to update the
Hecrepedia. After a hard work on remaking the Hecrepedia from the ground up, the members are too lazy to update it. Anywho, we began the expedition with prepartion
at a pre-determined local destination. I was given snaxe spray, a sticky hand, and a <strong>[CLASSIFIED INFORMATION]</strong> which is used to capture the Snaxii and allows the
observation of them.</p>

<p>The HBA member had a jeep with him and had many camping-like tools. Binoculars, a compass, a map, a camera, flashlight, instant noodles, and a rice cooker but no rice.
“What’s that for?” I asked. “Not gonna tell you until I need it.” We started driving into a forest, plains, and then a jungle. It was all uncharted territory, not shown
on google maps. Soon we stopped and we began walking. We were going around in what seemed like circles for quite a while. The sun was starting to go down. “I think
they know we’re here, we gotto throw off our scent.” The HBA member sprayed something from a bottle written in a strange, alien-looking script. “They won’t be able to
detect us now.” “What did you just spray?” “I can’t tell you. If you can read what is on the bottle you would know.” The bottle was working, soon we were seeing
movements in the grass and hearing a mix between hissing an purring. “There it is.” The HBA member leapt out and attacked. I was staying in hiding to stay safe,
remembering my Snaxe Safety tips. He came back with some shapeless pulp. “Just the run of the mill <a href="https://hecrepedia.github.io/animal/#27">plain snaxe</a>.” We weren’t
able to find any new species yet so we set up camp and slept for the night.</p>

<p>The next day pretty much followed the events of the first day: we weren’t able to find any new Snaxe species. The HBA member was going to continue his search but it
was time for me to head out. After all, the boss doesn’t pay me to stay until something exciting happens. The whirring of blades could be heard and above was a
helicopter with Wopps and Banana in it. “Mjir, you have to come with us right now, we finally found a good story.”</p>

<p>I was doubting the new story they found but I had nothing better to do so I hopped into the cop and we flew away.</p>

    <description>An article about Spooky Tales from a Spooky Site</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your life not scary enough? You may be someone in need of <a href="https://neeshtales.github.io">neesh tales</a>. We are not sponsored
but there is nothing else to write an article about and I’m gonna take the easy way out because my pay ain’t affected by no
quality or orginality.</p>

<p>When Neesh knocks at your door, there is no escape, he has already found you, you won’t be able to run or hide.</p>

<p>Neeshtales consists of very short stories written in Spanish and then translated into English. I got into a top-secret
interview with the author which cannot be disclosed but he did say they are planning for much more neesh, a play, a movie
script, and more! (I know that’s ambiguous but I’m just the reporter). In fact, there are many more neesh tales already
finished, but the author does not update the website. Those of you fancy with GitHub may notice I’ve made some commits there.
I have no affiliation to Neeshtales, I was conscripted to make the website and upload the first few stories.</p>

<p>On the surface Neesh tales seems like a playful joke. The short adages have barely any heft, at a cursory glance. Taking a
deeper dive into the diction and the events going on reveal the true horror ongoing with Neesh and his friends. I won’t go
into a deep analysis because there probably is a YouTuber who will do it in my stead but the character of Neesh is truly
frightening.</p>

<p>That’s all the effort allowed for today, make sure to share. We will actually produce better articles if more people read
this. The Hecrenews is the most reliable news source in the Hecresphere, mainly because no other news source dares to cover
all the news in the Hecresphere. Also rumors are going around the HBA is taking action once again, that may be an
interesting article…</p>

    <title>Man Grows Hamburgers in his Backyard</title>

    <description>An article about Man Grows Hamburgers in his Backyard</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kara Yao became fed up with constantly travelling to the local fast food resturants for his daily cuisine of a solid hamburger.
While sources disagree if it’s hamburgers or ambiguous burgers, the boss thinks hamburgers makes the title a bit juicier, so
what can I do?</p>

<p>“When was it you got tired of going into a fast food store?” I asked the man. “Aah, that takes me way, way, way, waay back! You
know, I was once watching this comedian and he said no one looks unhappy eating a burger. They can be sad walking into the
store, walking out the store, even ordering the food, but no one is sad eatinga burger.” “Wait, can I even say that in the
article, what if we get copystriked?” “Don’t know man, not my problem.” “Fair, fair. Anyways, when exactly did <em>you</em> stop going
to the fast food stores?” “It was a chilly Saturday morning. I had just got laid.” “Please elaborate.” “I got laid off from
work, I was then jobless. I needed a burger to cheer me up. Burgers bring joy to my life. I love them more than my girlfriend.”
“She’s gonna get mad.” “Don’t worry, she’s imaginary. Anyways, I went to the local fastfood store.” “Can you specify which
chain?” “There were various chains, but I don’t really remember any specific ones. I entered into the store, a blast of warm
air broke me from the shackles of the cold weather. The sweet aromas of the tasty foods seduced my nose.” “I’m gonna stop you
right there, we are a news company, the HBA has not made a poetry thing yet, so let’s try to remove all the fluff and get
straight to the chase.”</p>

<p>“I went to the counter and asked the worker if I could order the regular. She was new and didn’t know what I usually ordered so
I told her #23, 2 #41s, the #69, and the 3 #420s. I could tell by the look of her eyes what she was about to say, ‘I’m so sorry
sir, we are out of burgers for today.’ I was heartbroken. My day was already going downhill but now it was too much. In fact,
I was planning on ending everything right there.” “I’mma gonna stop you right there, that’s too dark for our viewers my friend.”
“Not to worry. See, I was about to end it all as soon as I got home, but for some reason I had a feeling to go and read the
Hecrenews. I don’t know why but this was fate. The article I read was about a foolish man who thought he could turn back time
by turning back all the clocks. That man was Adalbert Bulstrode.” “Is, he still is.” “Anyways, I saw his determination, his
worth ethic, the article was pretty bad but I could feel all the sensation, I could feel his aura just from reading that
article. And it didn’t end there, I read more and more articles, Bulstrode was becoming quite a famous person and was being
frequently featured in the Hecrenews. I also read about Fred Dome and how he took the initiative to take every single job. I
was inspired by them and I knew I couldn’t quit. I went to local self-proclaimed green thumb Ellena Donelly and sook aid. She
taught me all the basics of gardening. After a month of hands on training, I am finally ready for action. I made a homemade
burger, took the sesame seeds and placed them into the ground. I was changing my life.”</p>

<p>After arduous work which spanned months, Yao was finally able to bear the fruits of his labor. Although, he did not bear fruits,
but he beared burgers! I was ready to go to the boss with this half-effort article but something interesting happened. A gang
of kids, no, teenagers, went towards Yao. What’s this? The kids kidnapped Yao?! I was fearing for my own life so I ran out.
The last thing I heard was the teenagers saying, “You filthy non-veg” as they burned down his burger garden. It seems this
story is not over but boss pays for quantity, not quality. Anywho, boss promised to pay more if I continue to upload every day
so I guess there are more spicy articles in the Hecresphere coming your way!</p>

    <title>As Robocalls Become More Prominent, Teens Fight to Preserve a Way of Life</title>

    <description>An article about As Robocalls Become More Prominent, Teens Fight to Preserve a Way of Life</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dangit. Another interview with teens. I’m starting to think the boss is out of memory space in his brain, because if he hadn’t learned from <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/24/teenagers-turn-to-cannibalism-a-way-to-live-by-proverb.html">last time</a>, teens and me don’t go well together.</p>

<p>This time, instead of me going to whatever vile hangout they performed their cult rituals-I mean, fun activities,- in, they were coming to the office. In prep, the boss wanted to make the office as teen-friendly as possible. I thought that it was a disgusting idea. The boss thought that I would be perfect to oversee it.</p>

<p>After adding wheels to all the chairs, placing fidget spinners at any location that could possibly make a teen slightly nervous, and instructing the entire staff how to dab(the trick is in the flick of the wrist), we were finally ready to welcome the pipsqueaks.</p>

<p>Some background information before the interview for those of you who are not up to date with the news(for up-to date news, check out <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/">this website</a>). In our digital age, technology has become super duper powerful(official sciency term). It can be used to make food, cook food, and feed food. But one achievement has rocked the advertising industry. Robotic calling. This is when you pick up your phone and you have a conversation with someone who acts like they genuinely enjoy talking to you. Otherwise, people just get bored within the first minute when you start rambling about the history of potted plants(speaking from experience here). Now, instead of real people selling to you, robots can, and it’s made the process so much more efficient. But teenagers, who used to rely on man-made calls as a daily part of life, now are facing the possible threat of their culture going extinct.</p>

<p>The boss contacted a group of teen activists known as the Loop-Froots to report on this issue. Based in yadda yadda, you get the gist, they do stuff. When they walked in the front door, I was there, performing Orange Justice to make them feel more at home.</p>

<p>“Um, what are you doing, sir” An insubordinate teen dressed in a polo shirt asked.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? I’m protesting for the rights of Oranges. Isn’t that what this is supposed to be?”</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other like they were silently conferring something, and then nodded in agreement, with pitiful looks on their faces.</p>

<p>“Sure man, that’s what it’s about. Now can we start the interview?” Asked another boy, this one dressed in a white hoodie that had a red rectangle with the words “Hyped Up” written in it.</p>

<p>We walked into the conference room. The Loop Froots took a seat, and then I, deciding to assert my superiority, sat on the table, cross legged, with a 360 degree view of everyone.</p>

<p>“So tell me about you guys’ problem.”</p>

<p>The teens look back and forth between each other, trying to figure out who was going to talk first. It was clear that they hadn’t planned this, and had probably procrastinated writing their interview speech.</p>

<p>The boy in the polo shirt spoke “Well, since we didn’t really decide who was going to talk first, I am, since I feel like it. Banana, back when you were a teen, didn’t you love messing with people?”</p>

<p>The memories flooded back of the days when my friends and I would place ice inside people’s sodas to dilute it and ruin the flavor, just for fun. People used to get mad back then, but now people like it for some reason, so it’s just not good pranking anymore.</p>

<p>“Yeah, those were the good old days”</p>

<p>“You see, Banana, our entire day revolves around one thing. Lunch. Lunch is when we have unlimited access, you know. Us teens can do whatever. Some weirdos waste their time by playing random pixelated space shooting games on their tablets in the library, but us intellectuals devote this time to more useful pursuits.”</p>

<p>“And what might this pursuit be?”</p>

<p>“The pursuit of happiness, of course. And the way we do it is the best. You see, we go to every shady website possible and enter our phone numbers there. And viola, the calls start coming in. These advertisers have no idea it’s us who they are calling. And so we prank them. Oh you should have been there this one time when Jimothy got called by a used eraser salesman”</p>

<p>A tall, built boy with a squeaky voice piped up “Oh man, I still can’t look at an eraser now without laughing.”</p>

<p>To test his claim, I threw an eraser at his face. He started laughing, but due to my impeccable aim, it went inside his mouth. We now have to pay a hospital bill and Hecrenews is facing a lawsuit over a case of purposeful rubber poisoning.</p>

<p>After Jimothy was rushed to the hospital, the polo boy started speaking again.</p>

<p>“But lunch isn’t the same anymore, Banana. We are getting less and less real calls. It’s just these darn robocalls nowadays. You can’t troll a robot. They just continue talking. And now we just have no purpose during school. It’s just plain boring nowadays. And that’s why we took up the fight.”</p>

<p>“What fight? Who are you guys fighting?”</p>

<p>“Robots of course. Technically, robot companies. We’ve planned a protest in which we call the companies using robocalls and advertise to them in monotonous voices. Let’s see how they like that!”</p>

<p>The boss, who had been watching the whole time, seemed bored and understood this interview was going nowhere. For once, we were on the same page.</p>

<p>“Well, that seems like a brilliant idea. We wish you good luck. I just forgot, we have our daily 30 minute study session. Would you teens like to join?” I asked.</p>

<p>Just as I had expected, at the thought of prolonged studying, these teens yeeted out of the building. I congratulated myself for believing in teen stereotypes, told Wopps to handle the lawsuit, and promptly slept on the table.</p>

<p>Another Pulitzer-Worthy interview over. Maybe I can retire now.</p>

    <title>Mysterious White Van Parked Outside School</title>

    <description>An article about Mysterious White Van Parked Outside School</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carl Mugabe is a generous elderly man on a mission: to change local schoolkids’ lives for the better. After retiring from the head position of an esteemed protein supplement manufacturer, Mugabe decided that he would attempt to put a smile on every child’s face at a local school. Every day, Mugabe enters the parking lot in his white ice cream van, ready to serve the bored-out-of-their-minds students of Leafblower Elementary. Children flock to the van in droves, ready for sugary goodness to liberate them from the mind-numbing ordeals of K-5th grade. Mugabe tells us that since its creation, Free Ice Cream, inc. has been 100% non-profit. In  an interview, Mugabe tells Hecrenews reporter Fred Dome about how he started this oh-so-generous hobby.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, it’s always been about the kids. Ever since I first graduated from Leafblower, all I’ve done is look back on that mindless tedium of common core education I had to suffer. I don’t want other kids to suffer the same fate, so I brighten up their day a little with me trusty Ice-Cream Van. Yes, leaving the fitness job was no easy task, but I figured I had enough saved up to stop telling people about how their life problems could be fixed by Flab-be-gone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the last 7 years and 3 months, Carl Mugabe has been in the parking lot of Leafblower Elementary for every single recess time. Choosing to skip out on various psychiatric check-ups, haircuts, and even vehicle inspections was not an easy task, but Mugabe, an alumnus of Leafblower, did it without looking back, because “[he] couldn’t just sit around and let the kids succumb to the school system as [he] had.” Indeed, Carl did spend most of his time studying instead of eating ice cream. He almost entirely blames his superb education on the severe lack of an on-campus ice cream man, stating that his personal motto was “study, study studies, boy I ain’t got time for buddies” instead of the preferred “GIVE ICE CREAM OR ELSE.”</p>

<p><strong>The State of the School</strong></p>

<p>Mugabe hopes that with his services, “joy will return to Leafblower Elementary, so it’ll seem like the good old days  again.” Here, Carl references Daredevil Jack, a recklessly intrepid 5th grader who, when Mugabe was merely in kindergarten, was famous around the district for going really high on the swings and then jumping off. Everybody was in awe of his stunts, and the Elementary School economy flourished through the various action figures of Daredevil Jack and the endorsements that this oh-so-cool individual gave. Truly a golden age for Leafblower.</p>

<p>Sadly, this all changed when the school board hired a new principal in the middle of the year, Mr. Karo Cann. Cann made sure that the students would actually learn in school by making the executive decision to cart away the swingset, leaving only a forlorn-looking rusty metal slide in the playgorund. While legend has it that Daredevil Jack chained himself to the swingset and was carted away with it to regions unknown, we are only sure that he disappeared (or graduated) after the schoolyear ended. Gradually, the new establishment made Leafblower Elementary a  “learning environment”, where students were made to sit at desks and listen to teachers. Leafblower Elementary evolved from a haven of sorts to a dreary factory of excellent grades and hard workers. With Mugabe’s efforts, perhaps Leafblower Elementary can be restored to its former glory.</p>

<p><strong>Student Opinion</strong></p>

<p>During the past year of Mugabe’s magnanimous efforts, he has touched many hearts and minds, inspiring them to rise up against the establishment with the sugar in their veins and the spark of rebellion in their souls. One such revolutionary, fourth grader Kleen X (last name hidden in case the establishment is reading this), gives the Hecrenews his opinion on Mugabe:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When I first heard of this [Carl Mugabe] guy who gave students free ice cream every day in the parking lot, I was wary. Y’know, stranger danger and stuff. But there wasn’t anything to do during recess, except for testing your heat-caused-by-friction tolerance on that metal menace that used to be a slide. So I went to the van. At first, he was only selling shapeless pulp instead of the 27 flavors of ice cream he’s got today, but that was enough for me. I took the free stuff, and immediately opened my eyes. I saw how we were practically being forced to improve ourselves, and obviously didn’t stand for it. I then went around and gathered up a select group of like-minded individuals–No, I will not tell you who they are–and we started the revolution. It was just small acts at first, yawning in class and not maintaining eye contact with the teacher at all times, but we’ve since expanded. All thanks to that Mugabe man. Very kind of him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many other children echo Kleen’s sentiments and support Carl Mugabe’s efforts just as vehemently.</p>

<p>While teachers don’t necessarily agree with the children eating up free ice cream and revolutionary ideals, there isn’t a thing they can do. If they went out to reprimand Mugabe, a revolutionary could easily snap a photo and twist it so that they would appear to be receiving ice cream from him, and the teachers are well aware of this. The horror of being publicly excommunicated as a rebel sympathizer would be crushing to any current teacher at Leafblower.</p>

<p>Mugabe is creating a joyous environment that the elementary schoolers will remember for the rest of their lives. Who wouldn’t want free ice cream every day? Such a kind, caring old man. We should all strive to be more like Carl Mugabe, the saviour of Leafblower Elementary.</p>

<p>In other news, Leafblower Elementary faces a wave of resignations caused by an unforseen increase in “sugar rushed” schoolchildren. (full article coming soon– no paid DLC required)</p>

    <title>Woman Without Phone Unable to Call Anyone</title>

    <description>An article about Woman Without Phone Unable to Call Anyone</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elisaveta Eógan wanted to call her parents during the holiday season but was faced with a major problem: she had no phone.</p>

<p>“In this day and age everyone is able to communicate to anyone! Family, friends, and even strangers! I was horrified this
morning. I tried to call my parents, I tried to call my friends, I even tried to call my pet pangolin, no one picked up the
phone!” “How exactly were you trying to call these people?” I asked. “Well, everyone just says they simply call someone, so I
tried doing that. It didn’t work.” “Did you have a phone or something to call the people you were trying to call?” “No, I do
not have a phone.”</p>

<p>This is truly a sad turn-out of events. Turns out Eógan is not the only person who is unable to call people since she doesn’t
have a phone. Statics show 100% of people who do not have access to a phone are unable to call people. Science has proved it
is basically impossible to phone someone without some type of phone. The paper in question had many disclaimers because they
knew there would be that one guy who was gonna turn their microwave into a phone. Gosh darn that one guy, always making lives
harder for paper writers.</p>

<p>Scientists have instructed everyone in this situation to ‘stay calm’ and ‘do not panic’ as it is supposedly normal. However,
the people affected by the lack of phone cannot come to the real world terms of being unable to contact everyone. They’re gonna
miss out on all the gossip. Eógan was at work when she heard Susan and Billy just broke up, she didn’t even know they got
together! The lack of phone is causing time to leave these people behind, create quasi time travelers.</p>

<p>Time travelers are a big problem. They cause too many paradoxes. Just because a big big company like Marvel explains time
travel one way doesn’t mean it’s the correct or even only way. There are so many time travel paradoxes, it’s like opening
a can of worms and then trying to go into the past to tell yourself to not open the can of worms but by going into the past
you have basically opened the can of worms again. The Grandfather paradox is a popular one. If you go back in time and kill
your grandpa (why would you even do this, you wicked person!), what will happen? If your grandpa is not alive, he would
have never given birth to one of your parents and then you, meaning you do not exist and have never traveled back in time,
but you do exist, so what happens? People like to think about this problem but philosophy is not a legitimate job anymore.
Aristotle and Plato and Diogenes and all your favourite philosophers were seen as geniuses for their time, but in these times
no one gets paid for thinking random stuff like “What is it? I am? Am I? How to be?” In fact, many people aren’t even getting
paid because they are getting laid off! If I got a dollar for everytime I thought something random like those old philsophers
I would already be retired, maybe I would have the boss even working for me!</p>

<p>Anywho, I have gotten way past the effort point of writing this article in return for pay. If you want a better article (or
the full version) make sure you purchase the DLC.</p>

    <title>Earth's Revolution Causes Humans to Start Mad Sweating Sprees</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/06/05/earths-revolution-causes-humans-to-start-mad-sweating-sprees.html</link>

    <description>An article about Earth's Revolution Causes Humans to Start Mad Sweating Sprees</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Earth is having a revolution. Not akin to the revolution some poor old farmers had with one of the strongest and largest
empires in the world (looking at you 1776), but instead a spinny boi. Scientists around the globe have confirmed the Earth
spins around the Sun, which is at the center of the solar system. This spin around the Sun is called a revolution. There are
many conspiracies about the position of the Earth and the shape of the Earth. Some believe the Earth to be flat and some belive
the universe to rotate around the Earth. However, religion and beliefs do not matter because Adalbert Bulstrode has confirmed
the Earth to be a spherical shape and does indeed revolve around the sun. While we would love to share his calculations we do
not want an instance of
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/professor-flight-delay-terrorism-equation-american-airlines">this</a> happening.</p>

<p>Anywho, what is peculiar about giant rocks doing ballerina-esque movements is the effects the cause incurs. Specifically,
Homo Sapiens begin to start mad sweating. It doesn’t stop. Air Conditioners, fans, ice-cold drinks, drinks with ice in them,
popsicles, lighter clothing, all in vain. The hydro hydroxide begins leaking out of their bodies and they risk dehydration, oh
the poor creatures! “Tis darn heatery be baddening for me health!” says local Pere Nazar. “I was just up the attic going through
some old items and the water began trickling down me neck. I tried to wipe it off but it didn’t stop. Soon my arms and legs were
also attacked. The water I drank to keep me cool was being sucked out! It’s like I’m being noodle soup and the magical powers
are drinking all the soup and leaving a dry-wrinkled noodle behind. I ain’t want to be no noodle, I want to be noodle soup!”
Nazar then lost all common sense and began a long ramble about noodle soup, which brands are good, how to make it, and which
chefs are the most proficient.</p>

<p>The problems don’t end with Nazar, in fact they only begin with him. We asked the self-proclaimed green thumb, Ellena Donnelly,
to give us some insight on how she is affected by this revolution. “I can’t bear it! I do love bears but the heat is
unbearable!” It was then Wopps Minor barged into the interview and acted as an international police power- er, what’s that, oh
sorry, mixed up my paper on big T. Roosevelt into here, um, ah! Here we go- police power. “Stop right there, I know you are
about to make a bear pun. Puns are illegal in these parts of town, haven’t you heard the latest legislation?” “Wait,” I told
Wopps, “Wouldn’t that make a good article? You know we need more, this sounds like a good opportunity!” “I see,” said Wopps
before he zoomed off into the horizon. “Anyways, continuing with the interview, can you get right into the good stuff?” “Sure,”
said Donelley, “I’m sure most people are experience the ‘mad sweat’ you were talking about but as a green thumb, we have it
much worse. The plants we are growing are in danger. You may know some plants are well adapted to the extreme heat like cacti,
but these invasive species we are growing in our gardens from who-knows-where will barely be able to survive, if they survive
at all. Plants and us are not too different you see, they need water, food, and air. They use Nitrogren for food and CO2 for air
but basically the same stuff as us! All of the plants we raised, our babies, are going to struggle surviving without water.
It’s hard work but I can ration the water so my plants can keep on going.” It sure seems tuff for green thumbs to do their
stuff.</p>

<p>As with all problems in our world, Bulstrode is there to solve everything. “You see, in some places of the world there are
four seasons. Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall, <em>All you gotta do is calllllllll, and I’ll be the-</em> <strong>[DEMONITIZED]</strong>. Er,
sorry about that my 8th grade science teacher taught us that song to remember the seasons. So the season we are in is actually
called Summer. The days are elongated and the temperatures rise, you remember how I was talking about how
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/15/cause-of-trees-swaying.html">trees sway in the wind</a> right? Well because
of the tilt of the Earth, during this point in the revolution, our hemisphere exposes more surface area to the sun, it is
practically telling the sun, ‘yo big man, cook me up real good.’ To combat the heat our bodies sweat. The water flowing down
our bodies may seem gross to some people, but it is a way for us to cool down. It is actually an evolutionary advantage we
earned because we were able to run and keep running instead of having to stop and recharge like other animals. There is
nothing really you can do to stop the sweating, but a solution is to open windows. If you open your windows, you can let
air naturally come in. Make sure you have a mesh net to keep out the bugs. This is the most natural way and cuts down on
electricity. If push comes to shove, a fan is much better than an AC in terms of energy and resource, but if you must, make
sure you close the windows. “Wow Bulstrode, you sound like an even better environmentalist than Ellena Donnelly!” “Aw, don’t
flatter me like that.”</p>

<p>Bulstrode has once again come to save the day. Make sure you follow his tips and tricks to stay hip and not sick!</p>

    <description>An article about Something Newsworthy Happening Somewhere, Probably</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In very topical news, something is happening somewhere. First reported by Someone Somebody, this most likely newsworthy something is probably newsworthy. “Yadda Yadda Lorem Ipsum”, reflected Somebody after the newsworthy event(s). In response to something, some group of some people are acting somewhat newsworthy as well. We take you to the streets of somewhere, where something is happening, and that this is newsworthy (probably). Someone tells us “Somebody did something!”. Then somebody tells us “Someone did something!” From this we can conclude than something is happening somewhere, sometime. We go to somebody for further details:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Something somebody did is newsworthy! Um, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Somebody’s insight was very insightful. Sometime later, we figured out that somebody somewhere else also did something newsworthy, be prepared for a story on that newsworthy topic coming soon!</p>

<p>Since we are currently experiencing a <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/01/hecrenews-authors-experiencing-dearth-of-dirt.html">dearth of newsworthy information</a>, the never-flagging Hecrenews staff has been hard pressed to come up with a solution. In an effort to maintain the pristine article quality you know and tolerate, the Hecrenews will only report on truly newsworthy events. While this sometimes means that we leave the specifics of the articles to the minds of the readers, rest assured that we will always only post newsworthy content (Subjectively determined by people who are definitely in no way related to the Hecrenews).

    <title>Music Group Recieves Backlash on Song Delay</title>

    <description>An article about Music Group Recieves Backlash on Song Delay</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A brand new music group, ARMD, has already brought itself into a deep pool of controversy.</p>

<p>In actuality, ARMD is not a new music group, they simply have not released a new track. In this day and age something being
new is very fast. If it’s past a month it’s hard to call it new, pop culture doesn’t work the same way as science. Fans of
ARMD were eagerly awaiting the first track, it was speculated to be “the most epic and fire track ever heard” (said a local
fan of ARMD). ARMD has a <a href="https://armdmusic.github.io">website</a>, a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-330378554">soundcloud</a>, and
a <a href="https://twitter.com/ArmdMusic">twitter</a>. Most have been barren an empty until ARMD recently posted a tweet on their
twitter. ARMD has pushed back the release date of their first track to February 31st. Fans have lost it. ARMD has kept on
pushing back and pushing back the release date of their first track. The final push has caused fans to go past their boiling
point.</p>

<p>“We promise it will be fire,” says a member of ARMD during an exclusive interview. “We want this first track to be something
really special, it’s going to stand the test of time and everyone should be able to relate to it. We want to change the world
with our music. Many people believe music can’t do much, but if you create something really amazing, you can move people to a
cause.” The members of ARMD are scrambling to get their act together so they can release their first track. If they fail to
meet the February 31st timeline, they will probably fall under.</p>

<p>We asked ARMD how exactly they are going to make their track, and luckily they did answer us. “So first we were just chatting
during lunch ya know? We were just messing around talking about some random stuff and suddenly we just had an idea, it just
popped into our head! Next we just opened up a google doc and started writing some lyrics. So we made a chorus, that’s the
repeating thing, and then we just starting writing down some words. Now that we have that situated, we started working on the
beats. The beats are actually the hardest thing for us and we are still working on them. There are so many different sounds
to choose from and our sound guy doesn’t know who to write melodies.”</p>

<p>Finally, ARMD revealed the reason of their major delay. “We actually lost of one our members recently. No, not like that, he
just left the group. I mean, it’s not that he left we kinda forced him in and he never joined, so idk. Now we got a new guy
in and we kinda need to rewrite the lyrics.”</p>

<p>We are hoping ARMD is able to finally deliver on their promises. Subscribe to them on SoundCloud in case they do ever drop
their track (we are sponsored but they aren’t paying us, boss isn’t paying me much either).</p>

    <description>An article about Hecrenews Experiences Dearth of Dirt</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may have already deducted from our recent lack of article flow, the Hecrenews isn’t currently at maximum productivity. We have commented on this sad, sad fact already (see <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/30/news-hard-to-find.html">this article</a>). However, <strong>This is NOT Our Fault!</strong> The Hecrenews has always strove to deliver the highest of news quality, so what can we do when the news dries up? That’s right, the world is experiencing a dearth of dirt; nobody’s doing anything interesting!</p>

<p>To support your favorite news source (us) the Hecrenews recommends that you stir things up in these desolate, horribly boring times. Do something newsworthy. Seriously, we very much need it. The Hecrenews functions on news, after all it is half of our name. So, take to the streets. Dig a 15-foot pitfall. Jump off of an escalator. Anything interesting, please. We’re begging you. Hecrenews survives on vegetarian food, dank memes, and most importantly:  news. Do your part. Stir up some trouble today. Anything to help us write a couple more articles. <em>Anything…</em></p>

<hr />

<p>EDIT by Hecrenews Article Quality Control (HAC) - Wopps meant to say that Hecrenews survives on non-vegetarian food instead of endorsing the inferior veg. Smh. The lack of news probably got to his head or something.</p>

    <title>Child licks Candy Cane into Brutal Weapon During Lunchtime, Laughs Maniacally</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/05/30/child-licks-candy-cane-into-brutal-weapon-during-lunchtime-laughs-maniacally.html</link>

    <description>An article about Child licks Candy Cane into Brutal Weapon During Lunchtime, Laughs Maniacally</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday, numerous reports surfaced of a child buying a candy cane during lunchtime. Aside from the fact that we aren’t anywhere close to Christmas time, this situation was alarming for another, graver reason. As soon as he received the deadly implement, the child, whose identity is still unknown, started licking. Licking a candy cane. Despite the universally held precept that candy canes and popsicles are for biting, this child licked in open rebellion.</p>

<p>Our informants soon lost interest in the child’s pathological licking, and we are in the dark as to what happened until the attacks. They started during the last few minutes of lunch. All was quiet, until the child raised his weapon and started brandishing it, yelling incomprehensible warlike exclamations. Quickly, the rest of the student body evacuated the area. The school fencing team valiantly stayed behind, quickly licking down popsicles into dangerous weapons. What followed was a battle of epic proportions, akin to The Legendary Battle, we must say. Candy Cane vs. Popsicle. The child was ganged up on, but he pressed on, with the knowledge that with time, the fencing team’s strength (and popsicle length) would wane.</p>

<p>Passerby Horatio Fella was at the site of the confrontation as well, quickly drawing upon his considerable journalism skills to capture the image through the power of a No. 2 pencil and a legal pad. His shaky account of the battle reads as thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The kid and the other kids are squaring up, oh but the other kids don’t have weapons while the kid has his candy cane menace.
Oh wait, they’re buying popsicles! And thanking the lunch lady to boot.
Oh my goodness! They’re fencing! Or, at least the kids with the popsicles are fencing.
Oh no, the popsicles are melting. I repeat, THE POPSICLES ARE MELTING!
Oh… the candy cane child has them at cane-point. I can’t write this..
Oh. He sees me.
Ooohhh he’s coming towards me
OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHH</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All that the authorities recovered from Horatio were the legal pad and his left sock. The Kandy Kane Kid, as the locals have started referring to him, is still at large. The Hecrenews recommends not going to schools for whatever reason for maxmimum chances of survival.</p>

    <description>An article about News Hard to Find</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A barren desert. There is nothing but sand, pehaps a dead bush rolling along the valleys.</p>

<p>The Hecrenews is in this desert. News is hard to come by. The boss barely pays and still expects us to come up with content.
Wopps and Banana have both got no stories, and the same goes for me. We’ve asked some locals their opinion on this.</p>

<p>“I always think there’s news. Everything is important is it not?” -Andrey Alexandra</p>

<p>“Nothing much has been happening. It’s your average day.” -Abubakar Sima</p>

<p>“I’m so bored this interview is gonna be the most exciting part of today.” -Lakshmi Flora</p>

<p>“I just saw you interview those other three people, you must be pretty desperate.” -Chukwuma Gauri</p>

<p>Reflecting on what we do at the Hecrenews does bring us a renewed sense of pride. While we may struggle to pump out articles
each day, we will strive to be the most reliable news source in the Hecresphere, and that’s why we are! We will not come up
with lies just to make content everyday, we will not make clickbait headlines just to gather attention. We will cover what’s
important.</p>

<p>Sometimes there are rainy days and sometimes there are sunny days. It’s definetely a rainy day here at the Hecrenews as we
struggle to find what’s popping. But trust us, we ain’t stopping.</p>

    <description>An article about Vegetarian vs. Non-vegetarian Calamity Resolved</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Through the work of the HBA the non-vegetarian vs vegetarian calamity has ended. Hate is still lingers between the two factions
but peace has been achieved for now.</p>

<p>The HBA was able to solve this calamity because their team includes an omnivore. An omnivore as a person who eats both autotrophs
and heterotrophs. Without the omnivore (whose name we cannot disclose because the HBA is top secret) the HBA would have fallen
apart. After finding peace and stability within the HBA, the HBA sook out more omnivores to rise up to their plan.</p>

<p>The plan worked smoothly. Omnivores are now working as peace-keepers between vegetarians and non-vegetarains because they will not
choose a side and will not attack both sides because they believe in the ideas of both sides.</p>

<p>The HBA has sucessfully averted a mass crisis and is paving the way to a more peaceful world.</p>

    <title>Tasty Water Recipies</title>

    <description>An article about Tasty Water Recipies</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After meditating in the Himalayas for quite some time, I discovered some mouth watering recipies which will cause a revolution
in your taste buds.</p>

<p>It started when the vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian calamity began. Being a vegetarian living in a non-vegetarian community, life
was tough. As tensions escalated, it was actually getting rather dangerous, the non-vegetarians began persecuting thevegetarians
they knew. It was then I knew I had to make my escape. Planes and boats were too dangerous, but I needed to get to the other
side of the world. Luckily with my connections to the HBA, I was able to find a safe underground tunnel route one of my
colleagues made a long time ago, and the tunnels lead practically everywhere. Anywho, the journey to the otherside of the
planet took quite a while. I encountered a few plain snaxii and even some yellow snaxii (read more about snaxii at the
<a href="https://hecrepedia.github.io">hecrepedia</a>). Luckily I followed the
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/01/snaxing-guide.html">snaxing guidelines</a> created by the HBA and I had
myself some Snaxe Spray.</p>

<p>Soon I was smack dab in Nepal. It was quite rural so I was safe from the vegetarian and non-vegetarian riots happening in the
cities of where I am from.  The views were breath-taking (just like Keanu Reeves)</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/nepal_mountain_and_lake.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It took a while but eventually I was in the Himalayans peaks. It is quite dangerous and scary, but a calm mind can easily scale
it. Once I reached the peaks I just choose a spot and began meditating. I began to hear the voices of the universe and feel
all the life energy around me. It was getting pretty wacc but luckily I was broken from the meditative state with my stomach
calling for some food. There was nothing nearby and I did not pack any food with me, if a non-vegetarian found out I was a
vegetarian it would’ve been risky in those times. There was a huge slab of ice nearby and I just ate it.</p>

<p>That slab of ice was the most deliccious food I had ever eaten. The ice stays solid but after keeping it in your mouth for
some time it melts into a liquidy water and tastes like hydrogen and oxygen with some electrons flowing through it. It was
truly incredible. After seeing the calamity had ended on the Hecrenews site, I knew I had to share these recipies with the
world.</p>

<h1 id="boiled-water">Boiled Water</h1>
<p>Put water in a pot and set it for boiling. Serve hot or let it cool. Boil it for longer if you really want to kill those
microbes.</p>

<h1 id="scrambled-water">Scrambled Water</h1>
<p>Put some oil in a pan and heat it up. Put some water into the pan, it should be sizzling. Watch the texture of the water and
make sure to take it off and on the heat when needed.</p>

<p>Also add some black pepper and salt if you would like.</p>

<h1 id="ice">Ice</h1>
<p>Put some water into a container. Freeze the water using a freezer or other means (taking it up to the himalayas gives it the
best flavour). Serve cold.</p>

<p>Use cookie cutters to make fun shapes!</p>

<p>Those are all the recipies I am revealing for now. Make sure to get the Hecrenews cook book when it comes out (which I believe
is going to be February 31 but the boss said no promises).</p>

    <title>Mysterious Visitor From Space Appears Daily and Causes Insanity, Farmers are Freaking Out</title>

    <description>An article about Mysterious Visitor From Space Appears Daily and Causes Insanity, Farmers are Freaking Out</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had been sent out to Arkansas, where farmers said they’d been seeing another “mysterious visitor from space” in the sky. Fully expecting it to be just another interdimensional floating weasel, I took up the interview for one reason and one reason only: to pronounce Arkansas as Our Can Sauce in front of the locals.</p>

<p>My taxi took me from the airport(I didn’t know Arkansas had airports. Then again, I didn’t even know where Arkansas was, and still don’t know to this day) to the rural farming area, where I was to meet with Betsy The Shoe, whose parents obviously had good taste in names. When I got to their house, I was greeted by a huge sign of their company name, Farmers Who Farm for Food(FWFF). An elderly woman in generic farmers clothing(tye-dye T-Shirt, black leather pants, sandals, and a pair of spiked bracelets), helped me get out, and directed me to a set of chairs placed next to the anteater coop.</p>

<p>“Why do you have an anteater coop?” I asked, not sure of the response I would get(which is generally what happens to people who ask a question)</p>

<p>“For the eggs of course!” Betsy replied, as if that cleared up the situation. I decided not to press anymore and get to the matter at hand.</p>

<p>“Why did your parents name you Betsy The Shoe?”</p>

<p>“Same reason your parents named you Banana The Human. They had excellent taste.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes they did.” Memories of the snake(not snaxii) that had eaten my parents telling me about how savory they were resurfaced in my mind. I quickly pushed them away with the patented MemoryAway(Now Available at a Bar Near You!) button I had installed in my head. With the sponsor advertising out of the way, I finally remembered what the boss had sent me here for.</p>

<p>“So this visitor you farmers were hollering about. Describe it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, Banana, we were just living our normal lives, and then one day, when that other space invader went away, a new one showed up”</p>

<p>“Other space Invader?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. I guess its been naturalized to Earth now. Most people call it the sun. But the sun isn’t anything like this one. This ones….different.”</p>

<p>Betsy shuddered. She tried to hide her emotions, but they revealed the horrors her mind was showing her. I put on my BraveFace(Now with improved stretching capabilities), and pressed on.</p>

<p>“Could you tell me more, Betsy?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s like something out of Lovecraft. Its indescribable, causes madness when you see it. My brother Bobby the Boot once gazed upon its shape-shifting form and he went mad, muttering about the Cheesy Ones and some overlord named Dopey.”</p>

<p>“If you’ve, never seen it, how do you know it exists?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t just move around in the sky, it glows, Banana. The otherwise beautiful night is savagely transformed by it. It changes shape every night, sometimes round like the eye of the wicked cyclops, sometimes curved like the scythe of the reaper. It causes these grotesque shadows to appear, and their are howls that haunt us. And the water.”</p>

<p>Color drained from Betsy’s face. It was clear she was going through some sort of PTSD. I knew we needed to call in the forces to stop this vile visitor, but I needed to know more.</p>

<p>“Betsy, calm, it’s not going to get you right now. Now what happened to the water” I said, in my most calming voice(the trick is to pretend like you care about the other person’s feelings).</p>

<p>“It turned pale white, Banana! White, like bone! Barty the Bot drank from it, and he’s never been the same ever since. I swear, it’s like he’s been possessed. All he does is lock himself up in his room, spontaneously yelling “The Moldymen is coming!””</p>

<p>At this point, Betsy broke down into tears. I didn’t know what to say, or what to do. This visitor needed to be stopped, but how. I felt a faint tug in the back of my head when she mentioned the Moldymen. I swear I had heard a legend involving it. But that was long ago, and I needed to focus on the situation at hand. Suddenly, Betsy looked up, her eyes red and puffed, but she held a steely gaze.</p>

<p>“There it is” She spat, pointing behind me.</p>

<p>I whipped my head around(Crack!, went my Trachea). The sky seemed less saturated, more evil. The sun had been on the retreat during the interview, and I caught a glimpse of the visitor.</p>

<p>I cannot describe fully what I saw, for I was lucky that I had only seen a sliver of the thing, for any more would have driven me completely mad. The thing was a pure, blinding white. As my eyes laid upon it, images stabbed into my mind. An army marching down a desolate plain. A general, a man in Pajamas, and a fearsome warrior who emanated evil. And then I saw the most eldritch of horrors, those I cannot describe here, for they cannot be shown in words. My mind was slowly slipping away, breaking apart, becoming a sludgy soup for this visitor to feast upon.</p>

<p>I was only saved by the appearance of It. I do not know what else to call it, for my eyes rested on it for the most minute amount of time. But it seemed vaguely animal-like, with a large protrusion from its back. It shielded me from the light, and I snapped out of the trance I did not know I was in. Betsy was long gone by then, her face blank, her mouth making movements but no sounds coming out. Her eyes had clouded over; they were white with flecks of yellow and green.</p>

<p>I had to run, and run I did. I ran until I couldn’t anymore. Right before I collapsed, I sent a pager to a friend.</p>

<p>I was told Mjir found me, and using the tunnels that an old colleague of ours had built(he hadn’t been heard from for over 10 years, but that’s another story), he rushed me back to headquarters. Somehow they healed me, and I lived to tell the story.</p>

<p>The visitor is not gone. Not by a longshot. The creature that saved me may be still around, but to find it would be to delve into an era long-gone. After much thinking, I have concluded that the creature and the visitor are both older than we thought was possible. Legends have detailed a few things about a shark-like creature, a lost king, and an army of unstoppable dairy byproducts. God knows if these beings will appear, but I only hope that if they do, our faith in the Hecretary Bird’s power will be enough to protect our world.</p>

    <title>STAAR Test Accepted as new Speedrunning Category</title>

    <description>An article about STAAR Test Accepted as new Speedrunning Category</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In light of these recently troubling times (see <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/26/veg-vs-non-veg-tensions-escalate.html">The growing schism between nonveg and (inferior) veg</a>, <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/23/massive-quantities-of-food-disappear-during-lunchtime.html">disappearance of food during lunchtime</a>, and <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Become-a-Civil-War-Corpse">loss of consciousness during  the night hours</a>), the Hecrenews brings you a somewhat lighter story from our gaming divison.</p>

<p>Due to the insistent campaigning of a certain Wopps Minor, the Global Speedrun Association has included the State of Texas Assesment of Academic Readiness (STAAR) as an official speedrun. Besides the highly contested any%, categories include Commended%, NoPassage%, and the STAAR Gauntlet, in which the runner takes all of the tests. All of them. Every last one.</p>

<p>Professional STAAR Speedrunner Wopps Minor agreed to an interview, to talk about how the STAAR Test gained its spot of prominence:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Well, I think it all started with subvertin’ authorithy, wot. Y’know, telling the good ol’ bloomin’ establishment to put a sock in it. They give you four blazin’ hours to take the test, wot can ye do? So, us STAAR speeedrunners, we do the same tests, just faster. ‘S a way of life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, despite this sport’s newfound popularity, it has its naysayers. <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, for one, says that the STAAR test “is supposed to take the full length.” <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> and other founders of the newly created Take the Full Time initiative (TFT) state that just because you can turn the test in early, it isn’t wise. <em>(A/N: This is a load of hooey.)</em> The TFT is currently attempting to appeal the decision and void the STAAR speedrun, as it promotes “disrespect for the system” and “just ain’t nice to the rest of us.”</p>

<p>But at least for now, the decision stands, marking a new chapter in the story of speedrunning the STAAR Test. Currently, the record, set by another certain Wopps Minor, stands at 27:00.00. That’s all for now, stay tuned for a guide on the most common speedrunning techniques to get a leg up over the rest, brought to you solely by Hecrenews!</p>

    <description>An article about Vegetarian vs. Non-vegetarian Calamity</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a message we are recieving from the Hecretary Bird (through omens of course).</p>

<p>The surge in non-vegetarians vs. vegetarians has grown to frightening concerns, and in our effort to stay the most reliable
news source in the Hecresphere we cannot take sides on this issue.</p>

<p>However, all of our authors (minus the great Hecretary Bird of course) have bias based on their diets, so stay wary when
reading their articles. We do not want to persuade you to take a side, and please do not take a side just because your
favorite author has chosen a diet.</p>

<p>During this calamity the HBA will be working its hardest to end the conflict. Please stay tight and stay calm.
We can assure you, with the HBA’s help, everything will be fine. Trust in the HBA and the great Hecretary Bird.</p>

    <title>Highly Sus Carnivorous Herbivores Spotted in Japan</title>

    <description>An article about Highly Sus Carnivorous Herbivores Spotted in Japan</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This deer, and others like it, have been recently observed to be seen eating meat, on multiple occasions. What other words can we use to describe this event but simply wonderful? The first recorded sighting of a predominantly vegetarian creature eating nonveg food was actually recorded by Hecrenews’s very own Banana the Human. During an interview, Banana describes the incident.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yo, what’s popping, Wopps? Anyways, I was hunkering down in Japan, you know the reason, and I saw a deer. Now, you know me, avid follower of meat and the such, always have food on the body. So there I was,  chowing down on some shrimp, when I see it. A deer. It seemed strange, all bloodshot and stuff. Guess what happened next? It savagely attacked me! It just went ahead and took the shrimp that I offered to it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reports of this mysterious occurrence have only increased in recent times. Chipmunks eating monks, gazelles nibbling Adele, rhinos eating dinos (some of these events might be newsworthy on their own, but eh. Procrastination is quite compelling, you know). If you see what you thought was a vegetarian eating meat, do not be alarmed. This is only the course that nature takes. Survival of the fittest after all. As members of the inferior faction, what can the herbivores do? Improvise, adapt, overcome, that’s what. This is Wopps Minor, known non-veg, signing off.</p>

<p>If you are a vegetarian reading this, do not worry. There is help. We can cure you. Simply call <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">this number</a> for a free consultation and begin your (one-way) diet transition therapy today! The journey to nonvegetarianism starts here! (This textual advertisement was paid for by the MIG. Don’t be veg, take the pledge.</p>

<p>Note: The Hecrenews does not explicitly endorse one diet over the other. Implicitly, on the other hand…</p>

    <title>Vegetarian vs Non-Vegetarian Tensions Escalate</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/05/26/veg-vs-non-veg-tensions-escalate.html</link>

    <description>An article about Vegetarian vs Non-Vegetarian Tensions Escalate</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clara Dita was walking home from work when she was jumped by a gang of non-vegetarians. They threatened Dita with knives and
stones and stole her purse. Why did they do such a terrible thing? -Because Dita is a vegetarian.</p>

<p>“Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian are not simply choices of our diet, they define us,” said Koppel Burcu in 5000 B.C.E.
colorized. The diet people choose are raising tensions much more than race and religion. Fights are breaking out across the
nation bewteen vegetarians and non-vegetarians, and they cannot be stopped. The police cannot break up the riots, as they
join up with their sides and continue the fight. The government is in disarray, it is worse than pre-south-succession.
Imagine Sumner versus Brooks on a more massive scale. In fact, if you look outside the windows of your house, you might see a
fight breaking out. Even hospitals have identified themselves as vegetarian and non-vegetarian and a vegetarian hospital will
not help a non-vegetarian. One may wonder where vegans and other diets (such as the only milk diet) fit into this but the
truth is no one cares, especially for the vegans. The vegans who refuse to align their views with vegeterians and identify
themselves as vegetarians will be seen as vile as non-vegetarians to vegetarians.</p>

<p>The tensions between the non-vegetarians and the vegetarians are not new. In fact, they have existed for years but were
overshadowed by other contemporary issues. A vegetarian can easily identify a non-vegetarian, and a non-vegetarian can easily
identify a vegetarian, it is an innate ability of humans. Although the root cause is human nature, both sides have still come
up with reasons why they hate the other.</p>

<h2 id="vegetarians-argument">Vegetarians Argument</h2>

<p>Vegetarians believe non-vegetarians to be blood-thirsty human beings whose hunger for meat can never be quenched. Fast-food
chains are rampant across the country, and they are factories for breeding animals just to be fodder. Vegetarians are
symphathetic to these animals as they believe it is unfair for an animal to be born with the sole purpose of its life being
to be killed and then consumed, and it is worse for factories. The other important argument vegetarians make is the dominance
of the human species. Plants are very powerful beings, and if humans are not keeping them in check, plants can go out of
control. The other herbivores won’t have as much as an effect as humans. Trees will grow everywhere, plants will break
through the concrete. Although many believe plants and humans to have a symbiotic relationship of sorts, vegetarians are
fearful for the power plants can have if they are being kept in check. “Just look at the wild jungles of the world, it is
practically impossible to live there,” said Mynte Pauli. “Plants destroyed the homes of so many of my loved ones, we need to
strike back.” Of course there is more to the argument, but the boss does not pay me enough to investigate further.</p>

<h2 id="non-vegetarian-argument">Non-vegetarian Argument</h2>

<p>Non-vegetarians believe vegetarians to be a joke, they are just superior to vegetarians. Humans have evolved to be capable of
eating plants and animals. If humans continue to not eat animals, all the arduous years of evolution would have been in vain.
“If I worked a trillion hours on a project,” says Baldwin Abolfazl, “I would want the audience/client [he said the slash] to
use all of it. I wouldn’t want them to only use one thing and make the other part weaker. It’s like exercising. You gotta
exercise the whole body, you can’t just exercise your arms or else your legs will remain sticks.” “Is that a personal attack,”
I asked Abolfazl. “Also, if you need to work all of your muscles, shouldn’t you be eating vegetables too? The same argument
you made can be used against you if you don’t eat vegetables.” “I would never eat veggies,” said Abolfazl, “That would make
me a [strong language] vegetarian, and I can’t lose my reputation like that.”</p>

<p>So the two sides have hated each other for a very long time, but how did tensions exactly escalate? Take a gander at the
following graph:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/exponential.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The tensions are exponentially increasing. This data was given to me by Wopps Minor, and with Wopps Minor being a member of
the Hecrenews, you can trust its credibility.</p>

<p>Fights are breaking out more and more. This is becoming the new normal. Peace does not seem like an option any more. Protect
yourselves. To quote the ancient proverb: “Hide yo kids and hide yo wives!” We recommened not enaging in the violence but
still lock your windows, barricade your doors. When you see a fight run. If you seek help from either side, they will make
you fight for them. The times are becoming more and more dangerous. We asked Adalbert Bulstrode for his expert opinion but he
currently has no solution. His science team has been broken up due to internal schism over diet, and he is unable to create
a solution without their help.</p>

<p>Although, hope is always there, and as long as one has hope, one has not lost.</p>

    <title>Teenagers Turn to Cannibalism as a Way to Live by Proverb</title>

    <description>An article about Teenagers Turn to Cannibalism as a Way to Live by Proverb</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The boss had sent me on another boring story. I mean come on, I didn’t sign up to be a journalist to actually do stuff. Anyway, there I was, at the park, waiting for a group of teens who were supposed to meet me and tell me about their adherence to goodness or something. It was all a part of the boss’s “genius” idea to reach out to the younger audience. You know, expand the amount of people we feed false information to. I just told him we needed to do more camera interviews, dab a bit, and spout out words like “fly” and “jiggy”, but apparently teens nowadays weren’t into that kind of lingo.</p>

<p>They walked up to me as I was watching the five-year old trying so hard to shoot a hoop. It was quite amusing to laugh at a child’s incompetence(though sometimes their ridiculous parents don’t think so). When I turned around to face these teens, I was amazed by their attire. These teens looked so lame compared to the glory days. I used to rock them baggy pants and backwards caps, looking all fresh-like, and these teens were wearing a T-Shirt and sweatpants. SWEATPANTS!! Seriously, these teens seemed like the kind that would go on a field trip to an amusement park and steal some skittles, not the cool ones you would like to hangout with.</p>

<p>“Hello, sir, the name’s Blister” said their leader, who I could only identify as differing from the rest because he was an inch shorter than the rest.</p>

<p>“I’m the leader around these parts. Follow, me, we’ll show you to our hangout”</p>

<p>Holding back the urge to crack a short joke, I went along with this motley band of unfashionably dressed pubescent boys. They led me to the trailhead and headed into the brush.</p>

<p>“Hold up. You guys live in the forest?”</p>

<p>Blister turned around, a thoughtful expression on his face. “Yeah. If you think about it, all the world’s a forest. So you too live in the forest that is Earth.”</p>

<p>I thought about it, and it didn’t make any sense, so I continued following them through the trees, occasionally slapping myself in the face to bring back memories of mosquitoes biting(ever since the murder hornets took over, it was getting harder and harder to find those little suckers).</p>

<p>At last we came upon a very roughly-made camp. There was a group of tents lined in a circular shape, all around a central bonfire. Around the fire, a bunch of logs made up benches, and a couple of cages were placed in the far east side of the camp. Blister gestured for me to sit down, and a couple of the boys brought me some fresh, raw water.</p>

<p>“You’re gonna love this water, it’s been purified with only the finest salmonella,” Blister remarked.</p>

<p>Knowing how good salmonella was for the body, I downed it in one gulp. Then, for the first time in my career, I actually started an interview on time.</p>

<p>“So, why have you brought me here today?”</p>

<p>Blister called one of the boys, whispered something in his ear, and turned back to me. The boy ran off towards the east side of the camp, and I sensed something funny going on.</p>

<p>“Well, Banana, can I call you that, we wanted to show you our new way of life. Before we discovered this path, we were lost souls, with no moral compass.”</p>

<p>“Having no moral compass sucks man, I can tell you myself. You won’t believe how many times I’ve ended up in Chattanooga when I was looking for China” I told him, fondly reminiscing about my time at Aznee Land Central Bar.</p>

<p>Looking at me like I had just interrupted him, Blister continued. “Then I came along this proverb in one of those things you grown-ups always talk about. What is it, that weird paper compendium full of something called knowledge. Ah yes, I believe it’s called a pook. Anyway, within this particular pook, I found a line stating, “You are what you eat”. Underneath it, the writer of this pook detailed how being vegetarian would bring you immense happiness, and even though the whole vegetarianism causes happiness didn’t relate to the proverb above, we took it to heart. So we thought to ourselves, how does one become this state of happiness, this so called vegetarian. If you are what you eat, all we needed to do was eat one of those vegetarians. And Huzzah, I present to you, main course”.</p>

<p>The boy he had sent off came back, this time with another boy who was shackled. This boy was obviously happy, with a ridiculous grin on his face. He seemed so enlightened, that I almost wanted to believe eating him would give me happiness.</p>

<p>My pager buzzed, and I looked at the message. You didn’t get sent on this assignment to eat, fool. I snapped out of it, and turned back to Blister.</p>

<p>“That’s not food, that’s a dude.”</p>

<p>Blister looked shocked, and his boys seemed to get angrier.</p>

<p>“Ofcourse, that’s food, haven’t you been paying attention?”</p>

<p>Another boy, piped in, saying with a gruff voice “I’m going have to speak to your manager.”</p>

<p>“Thank you Karen, that’s exactly what we need to do”, Blister said.</p>

<p>“His name’s Karen?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Your name’s Banana.”</p>

<p>“Touche.”</p>

<p>“Well, Banana, you’ve offended my boys here. Usually we don’t eat you’re kind, but for you, we’ll make an exception.”</p>

<p>The boys all grinned menacingly, and I knew there was only one way out. I grabbed my cellphone, quickly dialing a number in.</p>

<p>“Come on da, pick up da”, I muttered to myself.</p>

<p>“Yo whaddup, its Wopps”</p>

<p>“Wopps, I’m gonna need an assist”</p>

<p>“Sure thing man, just tell me the flavor”</p>

<p>“French onion”</p>

<p>“Alright, brace yourself”</p>

<p>The boys didn’t know what hit them. From nowhere, a million gallons of soup flushed the entire forest, sweeping away the boys and being a better pollinator than those bees could ever be. I rode the wave out, never once looking back, silently thanking Wopps for his collection of Campbell. And that’s pretty much it. I deserve a Pulitzer for this article, if I say so myself(and I do).</p>

    <description>An article about Local Sports Team Loses Faith in Humanity After Name-selection Competition</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A local soccer team has recently announced their view of the complete and utter lack of humanity in humans after holding a community name-suggestion campaign. Having no idea what to call themselves, the group decided to hold an online name-selection competition in which the team would use the best community-suggested name. Whimpering, curled-into-a-fetal-position team captain Joke Hoes (pronounced Yok-Hoz) spoke with our reporters about the results:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh, it was horrible, man. Oh, no. I can see the names when I close my eyes! Every single one of them, so bad, in every sorta way. We’re soccer players, not gamers! Oohh, no. Ohno ohno ohno…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the more acceptable name suggestions were the “Nashville No-scopers” and the “Florida #$!$!@#$%#@-ers”, suggested by a very addled Bert Bullstrode. The team also had multiple requests that they make their name the “Rheumatic Redstoners”, or at the very least, the “Mississippi Minion-lovers”. Due to the plethora of name requests, the team spent many sleepless nights looking for the one sane, unironic suggestion (which of course didn’t exist). Their rapidly degrading mental sanities weren’t at all aided by the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/23/massive-quantities-of-food-disappear-during-lunchtime.html">disappearance of food items</a> or the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/23/billions-report-losing-consciousness-for-unknown-period-of-time-last-night.html">sporadic losses of consciousness</a>. Through the many long nights of searching for a name, Joke Hoes constantly wept for the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart, and the fall through the air of the true, wise ideals of humanity.</p>

<p>After much sorrowful deliberation, the team decided on the name that was objectively the least horrible. From now on, they will be the Houston, Texas HecreTaries, despite not knowing what a “hecretaries” is and living many hundreds of miles from Houston. Who knows? Maybe with their newfound identity, the HecreTaries will rise to success? But for now, they sit in sadness and silence, wondering what we have come to.</p>

    <title>Man makes Big Bucks with the help of Nigerian Prince</title>

    <description>An article about Man makes Big Bucks with the help of Nigerian Prince</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Isaiah Dobrila is a very lucky man. A few days ago Dobrila recieved an email in his inbox from the Prince of Nigeria, a person
with a high position and a lot of authority. The Prince’s wife was in very ill health and the Prince was needing a large sum to
pay for medical expenses. “The grammar in the email was kinda sus along with the sender, but I can forgive them because they are
probably doing their best to speak English.” The situation was quite strange. Apparently the Prince had recently made a large
deposit to a bank in the United States, clocking in at around $100,000,000 USD. Unfortunately, the Prince was having some sort
of trouble accessing his funds (Dobrila is not disclosing the email so we can only go off what he has told us in an interview).
The Prince needed to know Dobrila’s bank account so he could transfer the money. The Prince did not need all the money and was
willing to give Dobrilla 10% of the total amount. Doing the math Dobrila will be making $10,000,000! Dobrila happily gave his
bank account to the Prince as he was saving the life of his wife but there arose a problem.</p>

<p>The Prince was having some trouble accessing the account. He needed Dobrila’s social security number, his driver’s license, and
his credit card number. “It was at this moment I was starting to become a little bit more suspicious,” said Dobrila, “But still,
the Princess of Nigeria is in danger and I am helping to save her life!” Dobrila replied to the Prince’s email the next day
after collecting all his information. “I really hope his wife can be saved,” said Dobrila. “I myself had lost my wife to cancer
a couple of years ago, I know the pain of losing a loved one and I definetely do not want the King to go through the same
experience.” Dobrila’s personal histroy is leaving us in tears, but now comes the moment of truth. The Prince responded saying
it was sucessful but it would take about a week or so to process the information. Dobrila waited eagerly.</p>

<p>Dobrila recieved an email four days later at 3:42 AM. He was happy to see what was in the email. “The Prince’s wife had been
cured, the Prince was so grateful and I almost began crying. I looked in my bank account and there it was, the $10,000,000.”</p>

<p>We then asked Dobrila what he is going to do with the money. “Well, the health care costs are insane. I cannot believe they
charge as much as they do. I’m going to donate all of this money to help reduce the cost of healthcare. I met up with my good
friend Adalbert Bulstrode the other day and he’s doing some crazy science research. He can definetely reduce the cost of
healthcare because he’s crazy smart. It’s weird because he didn’t use to be so smart. He thought he could time travel by
changing the time of the clock but now he’s changing the world.”</p>

<p>Humans across nations uniting for good only breeds more good. Link up with people you know today and try to create positive
change.</p>

    <title>Math Teacher Accused of Academic Dishonesty</title>

    <description>An article about Math Teacher Accused of Academic Dishonesty</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Schools take pride in education. Rasing and education the top of the notch kids is their priority, but some schools also
believe in teaching kids morals. Academic Integrity is the honesty of the academics. Cheating causes grade inflations, and
does not properly evaluate the abilities of a kid. Unfortunately, math teacher Poldi Jehonathan was accused of academic
dishonesty by revealing the test answers to his students just before the test.</p>

<p>“Weeks before the test he was giving us math lessons,” says Codie Amedea, a student of Jehonathan. “Basically he would teach
us how to add numbers. For doing three plus five, we count to three, then add five more fingers, and then count all the
fingers in total to get eight. The test had the exact same questions. I mean it was two plus 7 but we were able to use the
same trick.”</p>

<p>“We regret the actions of Jehonathan and truly apologize to our students,” says Einarr Silge, the principal. “Jehonathan is
going to be terminated immediately and is suspended from future jobs at our district. We do not tolerate academic dishonestly, especially when a teacher is promoting it.” Jeonathan’s teaching of addition for the addition test proved to have many negative consequences, one cannot simply give the answers to a test without cheating.</p>

<p>Some supporters of Jehonathan have argued for him. “The test didn’t even have the same questions! Mr. Jehonathan gave the
answers to completely different problems, they weren’t on the test!” says Aquila Lalawethika. However, the test was about
addition, and Jehonathan taught his students how to add, therefore giving his students the test answers. “I’m just
disappointed,” says Florencio Elzbieta, another student of Jehonathan. “Giving us the answers to the test doesn’t show we
learned anything, my 1st grade year has been wasted.”</p>

<p>Truly the standards at the school are high, and with their strictness they are able to foster an environment of pure
education and learning and prepare bright students for the real world and allow them to become leaders who create positive
change.</p>

    <title>Massive quantities of Food Disappear during Lunchtime</title>

    <description>An article about Massive quantities of Food Disappear during Lunchtime</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stephani Wigmund placed a plate full of wheat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy onto the dining table at around noon. After not
even 15 minutes, the food had disappeared. “Why me?” said Wigmund, “I just wanted to put some food on the dining table, now
it’s all gone!”</p>

<p>Wigmund is one of millions whose food disappeared during lunchtime. “This food disappearing phenomenom is getting out of
hand,” says local scientist Phoebe Hermione. “Food is vital for the survival of humans, without it it’s very hard to live.”
Experts say you can survive without oxygen for 3 seconds, without water for 3 days, and without food for 3 weeks. Three weeks
is a long time, but with the surge of the skinny populus, even three hours could be too long without food. Investigators have
already begun work on finding a possible suspect, but have made no progress as of now.</p>

<p>It is possible multiple suspects are involved, as the lunch disappearing phenomenom is happening across all nations. “The
bandit must be stopped,” says Wigmund. Wigmund spent hours preparing a feast for her family only to have it all gone. The
amount of effort required to preapre a feast so huge is unimaginable, and we doubt she was actually able to do everything, but
we know she did.</p>

<p>In addition to the friendly local scientist, we asked food scientists for their expert insight as well. “Well,” begins Imaan
Radovan, “It could be possible that people are just eating their food. This would cause the disappearing effect. However, it
doesn’t explain the amnesia people are getting. Normally people will remember eating the food but it seems it is not the case.
Despite that I still strongly believe people are just eating their food.” We cannot trust the verit of Radovan’s claims
though, because disappearing does not correlate to eating. This is a strange mystery and times are getting tougher with
the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/23/billions-report-losing-consciousness-for-unknown-period-of-time-last-night.html">loss of consciousness phenomenom during night time</a>.
Strap on tight and stay calm, the best solution so far is to carefully watch your food and always keep it in your sights.</p>

    <description>An article about Billions report Losing Consciousness for Unknown Period of time Last Night</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BREAKING NEWS! Billions of anxious citizens have reported losing consciousness for some period of time last night. This is an extremely alarming event, and the Hecrenews currently has its best investigators at work to see if this global catastrophe spells doom for the human race. While the search for a cause of this attack is ongoing, we now bring you to some of the victims of this mysterious event. Local human Hou Mung-bean describes how it felt:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Last night, I was up reading this new novel I pirated, and my eyelids started closing. It was really alarming, it being out of my control and everything. Guess what? That wasn’t the end of it. I fought like mad to keep my eyes open, so that I wouldn’t miss any of the story. The fierce battle was going alright, when my mouth just involuntarily opened and I took this really weird big breath in and out– it was freaky. I don’t much remember what happened next, but when I came to, the sun was already out! 8 entire hours had passed, and I had no recollection of them! I recall thinking that I had discovered time travel, before I checked the news and found out about this horrific calamity”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There has been much speculation about this very mysterious happening, producing conspiracy theories ranging from periodic mass alien mind control to celestial beings accidentally performing a server reboot of the universe. While Hou later reported feeling “bright and cheery” after she gained consciousness, it is unsure whether she was made to feel this way by the alien overlord controlling her body during the night or not.</p>

<p>For now, the Hecrenews can offer a few pieces of adivse: Do not panic. Stay calm, and act with reason. And above all, dont close your eyes… or… “ahhhhhhh”, uh… don’t do that. Above all, don’t lay down for what.. whatever reason. Don.. OH NO, THEY’RE TAKING ME. DON’T MAKE MY MISTAK–</p>

    <title>Man Sues Book For not having any Images</title>

    <description>An article about Man Sues Book For not having any Images</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local Palve Sture was one day reading a book, but the book did not have any pictures. To Sture, this was an atrocious act, and
he took it up to the municipal court. We at the Hecrenews were able to get top notch footage (but no video) of the events which
occured during the trial. Since we are writers and not legal people, we only understood the gist of it, but it was a very
interesting trial.</p>

<p>The prosecution began. Sture’s attorney was very eloquent and talked about the history of books and the accessibility of
knowledge. “Knowledge should be open to everyone, it is knowledge which allows us to succeed in society, and to move society
forwards.” His speech went on for about 5 minutes, and then the defense began. Then the trial proceeded. Sture’s attorney’s
argument was basically how education should be made available to everyone, even those who couldn’t read so pictures should be
required in books.</p>

<p>An interesting turn was when the judge interrupted the procession and began asking some questions of her own. She asked Sture
about his education. It turns out Sture had dropped out of school in first grade to start his company. He said he was following
the great minds of Elon Musk and Steve Jobs and believed he was going to do better because he dropped out of school earlier. The
judge began laughing out loud and the jury was bemused and amused. The judge told him he simply hasn’t learned to read so the
argument of equal education to everyone is invalid. Sture had the opportunity to learn how to read in elementary school, but he
did not grasp that opportunity leaving him where he is now, a man who is unable to read books without pictures. The trial ended
and Sture did not win the lawsuit, but he was required to visit a tutor who would help him learn how to read English so he can
read books without pictures.</p>

    <title>Local Zoo adds Homo Sapiens to its Exhibit</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/05/21/local-zoo-adds-homo-sapiens-to-exhibit.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/05/21/local-zoo-adds-homo-sapiens-to-exhibit.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Local Zoo adds Homo Sapiens to its Exhibit</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The zoo is home to many exotic animals. Tigers, lions, turtles, scorpions, monkeys, penguins- an entire article could be written listing
out all the animals a zoo has. One particular local zoo has introduced a new animal into their collection: the Homo Sapien.</p>

<p>“We can’t let you see it yet, in fact the homo sapien will not be in our exhibit for some time to the public and news. When we receive
a new animal, we want to let it know its going to be okay and let them adjust to their new home. We do not simply collect animals and
display them, we take care of animals and eventually return them back into the wild. We take care of injured and endangered animals,
and parents love to donate to a great cause. Taking care of all these animals is my passion and it’s truly a gift I can do it for my
job.” - Deep Shinsuke, Manager</p>

<p>The homo sapien is an invasive species believed to have originated from somewhere in Africa. The species has caused a lot of destruction
to the environment and caused many animals to lose their habitats and even go extinct. We asked Shinsuke, “Why take care of such a
dangerous animal? They are not injured or endangered? And they are invasive species, isn’t that bad?”</p>

<p>“Well it’s true that these species have caused a lot of destruction to the environment but these animals are still injured. While you
typically see animals with physical injuries, Homo Sapiens tend to have mental and emotional injuries. This is especially true of the
adolescents. Homo Sapiens are very social creatures, and the adolescents are always looking for relationships but keep on frequently
breaking up, this caused major emotional damage for both the males and females and we believe they are not ready to be released back
into the wild.”</p>

<p>Not everyone believes in the protecting of the Homo Sapiens, many people believe they are a threat and have the same fears and concerns
we expressed to Shinsuke.</p>

<p>“Aah, Homo Sapiens. You know what I think? I’ma gonna tell you what I think. Those [strong language] creatures are the worst creatures
ever. You know what? They should go extinct. Not only should they go extinct, they should go to-“ -Katarina Dietmar, Local</p>

<p>“Homo Sapiens? Ah! I’ve heard of those in my 9th grade biology class! This brings back memories. [skip past nostalgic talk] But getting
back to the matter at hand, I am a strong anti-invasive activist. Invasive species just cause so much damage. An ecosystem takes a long
time to stabilize, a long time to achieve that perfect balance. Then an invasive species just comes in and destroys everything. They
disrupt ecosystems and cause major problems for the local species. It’s kinda like the quartering act except there are no rules in the
wild. It’s not that I am scared of Homo Sapiens [starts shuddering and acting nervous] but I do not believe the zoo is a place for them” - Naldo Kronoz, Local</p>

<p>The general public is against the zoo’s decision to house the Homo Sapiens. However, there are just a tiny batch of people who share
Shinsuke’s views on the creatures.</p>

<p>“You know, I just kinda feel for them. I feel like I just connect with them. Ya know what I’m saying? Getting bullied in school, then
receiving all the blame when things go wrong. I want to help them too.” -Nontle Shachar, Local</p>

<p>The zoo isn’t going to add the Homo Sapiens to it’s exhibit anytime soon, the process is going to take some time but Shinsuke does not
want to rush the animals and wants them to take their time. While the zoo is making bold strides in diversifying its species, the
backlash from housing the animals is not going to go away soon. Keep your eyes peeled and you might see a Homo Sapien the next time you
go to a zoo.</p>

    <title>Man Takes Initiative during Social Distancing, Ends up with Every Job</title>

    <description>An article about Man Takes Initiative during Social Distancing, Ends up with Every Job</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you been doing anything productive during these times? For one local resident, the answer is a resounding YES. Fred Dome, 26, has taken it upon himself to self-improve with all of his free time. Just hours after the lockdown started, Fred Dome employed a variety of methods to improve himself mentally, physically, spiritually, and demographically. In an interview given to rookie reporter Fred Dome, Dome describes his training regimen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Yeah, it was pretty intense. I worked on improving myself for a solid, maybe 25-26 hours a day. But hey, I got through it, and so can you, by purchasing Fred Dome’s Time Turners! Increase your productivity like you’ve never imagined!”
<em>[Dome remarks that he was put up to this by the advertising agency that he works for]</em>
“So, I decided to put all that work to good use. Was getting bored moping ‘round the house, so I signed up for a couple jobs”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With his newfound skill, Dome decided to apply for a couple of jobs online, “part time of course”. Due to the decrease in the workforce caused by social distancing, owners were all too happy to hire Dune, for anything. As Dome puts it, “one thing led to another” and he soon had every job. Literally every job. Virtually, Fred Dome is essentially responsible for the future of the human race at this point.</p>

<p>Currently, an average day in the life of Dune starts at 12:00 am and ends at 6:00 am. He starts by going on his mail route, which takes him to his supermarket job, after which he drives a delivery truck halfway across the country, after which he works as a TSA Official in an almost-empty airport. After working his first four shifts, Fred Dome opens his eyes. After mowing dozens of lawns, designing a website or two, and streaming some Hecretary Bird TCG: Online, Dome stretches a bit. This pattern continues well into the day and night, when at 6:00 am Dome realizes that he’s about six hours late for his job at the Post Office. Godspeed, Fred Dome.</p>

<p>Once president Dome ends the quarantine and people can work like normal again, there may be some unemployment issues as people whose jobs have been taken by Dome have nowhere to go. But eh, that’s tomorrow’s problem.</p>

<hr />

<p>What have you been up to in the past couple of weeks? Is it pathetically worthless in comparison to the astounding productivity of Fred Dome? Comment down below! (jk we don’t have comments)</p>

<p>This article was co-authored by Fred Dome, independent contracted writer</p>

    <description>An article about Due to Social Distancing, Gangstas Have Found New and Innovative Ways to Conduct Shady Deals</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“And that’s why round pizzas come in square boxes”, a cracking voice said.</p>

<p>“Well, thanks for the interview, Chancellor. We still down for hopscotch at 5?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Ofcourse, man, I wouldn’t miss it for the world”</p>

<p>“Alright then, goodbye, Chancellor”, I said, hanging up the phone too early for him to respond. It had been a long day at the office, and I was looking forward to a good long nap, but then the phone rang again.</p>

<p>“Who is it and what do you want?”</p>

<p>“It’s your boss, the guy who pays you, fool. Listen, I’ve got a lead on a story in downtown Chattanooga. You’re heading there now”</p>

<p>The phone went dead, and I sighed, muttering some Farsi curses under my breath. But I knew better than to argue with the boss, so after saying goodbye to Mjir and giving Wopps my last Chocolate Z-Bar(fully knowing it would go uneaten), I headed off to Chattanooga.</p>

<p>When I stepped onto the platform inside the Hot Pot Joint, I was immediately taken aback. There were barely any folks milling around, and definitely no suspicious black jacketed persons squatting at the corners of the station. Man, quarantine really sucked the life out of this city.</p>

<p>My contact was waiting for me at a bright yellow bench, the same one that supposedly was sat upon by a famous gangsta gangsta, but I knew too well than to believe such legends. I approached him and held out my hand, but he jumped up and shuffled backwards.</p>

<p>“What do you think you’re doin homie, that isn’t six foot!”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry man, I’ve already downed 2 tide pods, spaced 12 hours apart, I don’t got the virus man”.</p>

<p>Refusing to come any closer, my contact sat himself on another bench, exactly six feet away, and asked me to start the interview.</p>

<p>“Allright, my name’s Banana The Human, representing Hecrenews, yadda yadda yadda. What’s your name and what do you gotta tell us about this here situation?”</p>

<p>“Yo yo yo, my name is Baby Joe”</p>

<p>“Uh huh, and what’s going on Baby Joe”</p>

<p>“You see, Banana, I belong to a gangsta gang. Mind you, not a gangsta gangsta gang, they haven’t been seen in quite some time, but just a regular gangsta gang. And in this gang, we do shady dealings quite often, but due to this darned virus, we aren’t able to meet each other in back alleys in close proximity and conduct such dealings.”</p>

<p>I nodded my head, pretending to listen, but I was already distracted by the feral cat behind him, staring at me with a murderous look in its eyes. While this intense mental battle was occurring, Baby Joe was rambling about his first time doing a shady deal, but since I was too focused on the cat to write it down, I’m just gonna give you, the reader(who we thank and stuff), the general gist of it.</p>

<p>Baby Joe mentioned something about the backside of some Central Bar, the name was hard to catch for me since it sounded like he was just sneezing. He nostalgically reminisced about how he remembered a shuffling of hands and the delight of eating the Twinkies after the deal, and all the while I was jerking my head back and forth to provide some semblance of paying attention, my full focus still on the cat.</p>

<p>“And that brings me to what we gangstas have been doing to keep the tradition alive, Banana. Banana?. You listening? HELLOOO”</p>

<p>I had almost finished off the cat, but this fool broke my attention for just enough time for it to safely get away. I angrily turned back to him, ready to get this over with.</p>

<p>“Yeah yeah, tell me what you have been doing, I’m sure its novel and laudable”</p>

<p>“So, you see, since we can’t come into physical contact anymore, we decided to leave the goods in a place were we could all take turns coming too. We thought about it a lot, and we decided the Chattanooga Jail would be perfect. All we do is get arrested, go to the jail, and the goods are waiting for us right there!” Isn’t it genius?”</p>

<p>This was shaping up to be quite the interview. “Genius? I think that’s downleft brilliant! Tell me, what do you do to get arrested”</p>

<p>“My mom would be so proud of me, you know, if she knew I had been arrested 43 times for attempted theft of a potted plant.</p>

<p>“So how many houses have you tried stealing from?”</p>

<p>“Just the one, my mom’s house. She has this one jocose plant on her windowsill, and I break the windows every time to get in, but right before I can escape with the plant, I always get distracted by my old stuffed Snaxii and play with it. In that time, the po-po show up and arrest me. I’ll get that plant some day”.</p>

<p>Before I could continue grilling him, my phone started vibrating profusely in my pocket. When I answered the call, a familiar voice tickled my eardrums.</p>

<p>“Well, fool, looks like you’re job is done. Come back to the office fast. It looks like that Z-Bar you left is still on the table, and we are gonna need you to throw it away. We don’t want another Bosco Sticks incident, do we now?”</p>

<p>And, as usual, he hung  the call before I could respond. I said my goodbyes to Baby Joe, who was quite confused as to why I was leaving so fast, but accepted it nevertheless. We traded pager numbers and I told him to buzz me when he finally got that plant. I looked around for that cat one last time, and then stepped on the hyperloop to head back to the office. Those Z-Bars weren’t going to cause a plague themselves.</p>

    <title>Lewis and Clark Encounter Bhalu</title>

    <description>An article about Lewis and Clark Encounter Bhalu</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year 1804. The President is mad-lad Thomas Jefferson. Reduced the Navy to uphold his beliefs of a weaker central government.
Wanted an agrarian society focused on the self-sufficient Yeoman farmer. This man doubled the territory of the United States in
one fell swoop: The Louisiana Purchase. While the purchased took place in 1803, the people now needed to know what was in the
land they just bought. In comes frontiersmen Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, a daring duo who were ready to explore the
vast new area.</p>

<p>One of the most fascinating encounters of Lewis and Clark was their encounter with Bhalu. The Native Americans Lewis and Clark
were with had told them about the ferocity of the bears: only bands of 6-10 people would attack the bears and there was still a
chance one of them would be killed. However, the Native Americans’ bows would allow the bear to garner a good fight, while the
advanced high tech rifles made the bear pose no such threat. Lewis and Clark go on to describe the creatures.</p>

<p>“[A] most remendous looking animal, and extreemly hard to kill”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Merriwether Lewis</li>
</ul>

<p>“[A] verry large and a turrible looking animal”</p>

<ul>
  <li>William Clark</li>
</ul>

<p>Ignoring their “turrible” spelling, Lewis and Clark described the bears as fierce creatures, even though they had their rifles.
Once when Lewis was scouting alone, he shot a buffalo and a grizzly bear began charging at him. Lewis’ rifle was not reloaded
and was not ready to be fired. The bear was fast approaching. In the open field, the only protection was a river. Lewis went
into the water and the bear suddenly turned back and ran away. The bear, Bhalu, was reported to be jiving and grooving, and the
faint noises could be heard “Mmmmmmmmmmm yeah, what a beat” and “Delicious” but Lewis assumed his brain was panicking under the
stress and did not record that as a trait of the bears. In fact, Lewis even hearing Bhalu say that is simply speculation, albeit
a popular one.</p>

<p>The bears were proving to be a fearsome challenge. Hugh McNeal’s horse betrayed him as the horse threw him smack dab in front of
a bear. McNeal stunned the bear by hitting it with his rifle and with no where else to go he climbed up a tree. Bears are big
and mighty but they cannot climb trees. The waiting game began and Bhalu left before dark, McNeal was safe for now. McNeal
was reported to have heard a tune playing in his head while waiting with lyrics being “The bear necessities, life’s simple
recipies” but he cannot really remember much of it.</p>

<p>Bears are fascinating creatures and hold deep symbolic meaning. The old days of frontier and exploration are long gone, but the
expedition of Lewis and Clark gives us a wide view into the natural America and what it could have been like if it was not
touched by humans.</p>

<p>EDIT: After speaking to a bear expert, bears are actually very good at climbing trees. McNeal was quite lucky that day!</p>

    <description>An article about Schoolteacher Devotes Life to Changing Those of Criminals</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When most of us hear about break-ins and robberies, we shake our heads and move on with life. “Criminals will be criminals, after all.” But not Ms. Eritrea Take. Feeling empathy and remorse for the criminals, she took a number of them in an enrolled them in her very own Ms. Take’s School for Uncouth Criminals. Hecrenews correspondent Mark Down was able to secure an interview with this kind soul, to really find out if the school works to rehabilitate criminals.</p>

<p>Down: “Well, it’s great to finally meet you Miss Take. I mean, er, my mistake, I meant Mrs. Take. You are married, right? Um.. HEY, SCRAWNY SCRIBE BOY! DONT YOU DARE WRITE DOWN WHAT IM SAYING RIGHT NOW CUT IT RIGHT NOW THIS PART– OUT OF THE INTERVIEW CU–”</p>

<p><em>[Down continues to abuse the <del>handsome, muscular</del> altogether quite scrawny scribe for some time, <del>who takes advantage of the fact that the Hecrenews doesn’t have an editor</del>]</em></p>

<p>Take: “Ahem, I thought you were interviewing me, not that poor boy”</p>

<p>“Right, right. So, what gave you the idea to reform these criminals?”</p>

<p>“Well, growing up, I had a criminal in the family. Our dog constantly took scraps from our dinner table, without any manners whatsoever. Later, I saw so many crimes on <em>[inferior news source to the Hecrenews]</em> and just compared those criminals to my dog. I was horrified that the criminals were all so blunt in their actions. So I decided to take them in and teach them some manners, so that they could go back out into  the world and steal politely.”</p>

<p>“Wait, you’re not helping them give up committing crimes?”</p>

<p>“No, why would I? They’re required to give a small cut of every job to me, you know. No such thing as a free education.”</p>

<p><em>[At this point, Mark Down starts sweating profusely]</em></p>

<p>“You mean there’s filthy criminals in this building RIGHT NOW!?”</p>

<p><em>[At this point, a “filthy criminal” passes by a window, giving Mark Down a filthy look]</em></p>

<p>“There are criminals in here, but they’re not filthy! We teach them many useful skills in politeness and being mannerly. Here’s a schedule of our day-to-day activities.”</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/criminal_manners_schedule.JPG" alt="YEE" /></p>

<p>Pictured above is the usual schedule of a student at Ms. Take’s.</p>

<p>Our correspondent was unable to continue the interview, for purposefully ambiguous reasons. We then inquired about Ms. Take’s most recent graduating class. When the investigative team arrived at the nearest town, they were privy to a wasteland full of broken windows and looted storefronts. We inquired, and it seemed that the townspeople had experienced a massive surge of crime. However, they had nothing but good things to say about this.</p>

<p>A local woman’s take on the situation:</p>

<p>“When the gentlemen broke into my home to steal everything I owned, they apologized profusely. They didn’t mouth off like normal criminals when they saw my kids. Overall, it was a very pleasurable experience. In the end, I was pleasantly chatting with one of them while the others were rifling through my cabinets. I would rate this a 10/10. Can’t wait to get robbed again!”</p>

<p>Fearing for their mental sanity, our investigative team questioned no one else. The long-term effects of these new “Criminals that aren’t Animals (CTAA)”, as they call themselves, remain to be seen. This is Wopps Minor for the Hecrenews Crime and Punishment section, signing off.</p>

    <title>Summer Vacation causes kids Homework to drop to Zero</title>

    <description>An article about Summer Vacation causes kids Homework to drop to Zero</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diligent students are always working throughout the year. Teachers are loading students with assignments so they are ready for
their future.</p>

<p>“Mitochondira is the powerhouse of the cell,” said Gordonpointy Shdon. Shdon has passed many job interviews but keeps on finding
new jobs. “I still haven’t found the one thing I like yet. It’s fun trying out my options, since I have so many.” Shdon is one
of many students who attends school.</p>

<p>School is an educational institution aimed at teaching kids acadmeics, the arts, and mental health to prepare kids for
independent lives as adults. A key factor in many classes is the assigning of homework. “Homework allows students to not only
review the content we went over in class, but master it,” says anonymous teacher. “Usually our next lesson builds up on the
other one. There
is a saying that 10,000 hours are needed to master something. Maybe that’s needed to master a skill, but by completing the
homework, our students are able to master a specific concept which will be vital to the next lesson. Also by focusing the
homework on a specific skill, we can easily identitfy the problem if a student requires aid.”</p>

<p>However, during the summer homework rates are dropping to zero. “It’s called Summer vacation,” says Shdon. “We get a break from
school so we don’t have to do homework.” Teachers are eagerly waiting for the summer pandemic to end, atlhough some report
summer is an annual event, especially science teachers. Summer has a drastic effect on the lives of both teachers and students,
and students especially quite enjoy summer vacation. “I do hope summer goes by fast so I can continue interaction with other
humans like a normal person” Shdon says.</p>

    <title>Cause of Trees Swaying</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/05/15/cause-of-trees-swaying.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/05/15/cause-of-trees-swaying.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Cause of Trees Swaying</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trees have been around for millions of years, and even a single year is a large amount of time. The dinosaurs used trees for
shelter, food, and shade and even we humans use them the same way today, although other animals may be using trees for habitats
more than us. The question lighting the community on fire is “how are trees swaying?”</p>

<h2 id="the-witch-theorem">The witch theorem</h2>

<p>Salem Massachusetts, now there is enough context. Some citizens believe the witches are still alive and the trees swaying are
their work.</p>

<p>“I just know it. It isn’t natural for a tree to move like that. Trees are like rocks, unshakable. There’s a supernatural force
moving them,” said Dean Phillip, a local wizard.</p>

<p>Phillip and his guild have been fighting witches for centuries. They know all the witches were not eradicated during the Salem
Witch Trials, they even know that those accused of being witches during the time were not witches, they were just regular people
but the community was scared and believed a prank being played by some children. The wizards are adamant about their answer and
will not believe otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="the-plant-gang">The plant gang</h2>

<p>There are some naturalist who beleive plants to have an immense hidden power humans cannot see. These naturalist believe the
trees swaying are just a way of trees imposing their dominance.</p>

<p>“One day they’re gonna up’n uproot themselves and take over the world. We better be kind to them while we have the chance,” said
self proclaimed green thumb Ellena Donnelly.</p>

<p>Most civilians believe the theory of the plant gang to be too radical, and are looking for a more realistic answer to their
claim.</p>

<h2 id="the-wind">The wind</h2>

<p>Physisict student Adalbert Bulstrode (a familiar friend of ours on the Hecrenews) made an outstanding discovery. “Plants sway
because of the wind, in fact, English professors say ‘plants sway in the wind.’” Bulstrode is already proving himself to be a
capable scientist, and his learning quickly, eager to prove to the world one can actually improve from a mistake. “You see the
way heat works, the sun heats up air near the ground of the Earth. Heat means more energy and the air by the ground is going
to rise up, while the cooler air towards the atmosphere is going to want to fall down. This cycle has a little more
complications and nuances but basically this causes wind, and the wind is what causes trees to sway.” Bulstrode elegantly
describes the cause of the tree swaying phenomena and puts an end to this mystery. Bulstrode has a bright future ahead of him
and he is eager to help out the community by teaching the science he learned.</p>

    <description>An article about Arcaheologists Excavate Ancient Murals</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently a famous archaeologist group (of whose name is unknown) recently excavated ancient murals from 5000 B.C. The team was
very careful in ensuring they did not damage any of the murals, as they were highly fragile.</p>

<p>“Ya know it’s oua job to dig up these fossils and things, its pretty cool. Get ya hands dirty and find cool rocks.”</p>

<p>-Gilderoy Bones</p>

<p>Archaeologists are able to teach us about the culture and history of our world. Their work is invaluable to history teachers as
it gives them more homework to give to their students. These murals express the human nature and are rooted in deep symbolism.
The archaeologists have also taken the liberties to colorize the pictures to make them even more realistsic. Here are the photos.</p>

    <title>Changing the clock's time does not allow you to time travel</title>

    <description>An article about Changing the clock's time does not allow you to time travel</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon a young man attempted to time travel by changing the time of all the clocks
in his house. He then invited his friends over and said “let’s experience the 90s together!”
His friends thought he was an absolute lunatic and mentioned that their phones were still
showing the year 2020.</p>

<p>Adalbert Bulstrode is the man who tried to time travel with his innovate but ingenious idea.
We sent one of our journalists to interview the man, here is the conversation they had.</p>

<p><em>Interviewer</em>: Hello, how are you doing?</p>

<p><em>Bulstrode</em>: I’m doing good how about you?</p>

<p>I’m doing good as well. Do you feel any different after changing the clocks forward and backwards,
any weird effects of you “time-travel.”</p>

<p>Not really and even if you used a method like in the movies you wouldn’t feel anything strange,
you just hop into a different time period and hop right out.</p>

<p>Do you realize the works physicists have been doing for years on time travel and how they were
unsuccessful? You barely passed college, why do you believe you can do something even the smartest
people have not done yet.</p>

<p>I don’t really like the mindset you have about me not being able to do it just because the smart
people cannot do it. I believe everyone has a chance so I just did it.</p>

<p>That’s fair, I apologize for anyone listening to this interview in the future, but why do you think
it worked? The clocks in your house are not the ones controlling time. The standard time is something
we all agree on, you are just changing your measure of time different from the standard time we have.
It’s not about breaking the norms, you simply have not done anything by changing the clock back, and
if you change it into the future, you won’t be in the future.</p>

<p>But I did it and it worked.</p>

<p>What do you mean it worked? You don’t have any evidence of it working. When your friends came over, their
clocks still said 2020, so what do you have to say about that?</p>

<p>You know they’re just wrong.</p>

<p>Look, the clock does not control time. It is just two sticks pointing to some ticks! Everyone can interpret
time differently, but time just keeps on moving. You can’t stop the flow of it and you can’t go back and
forwards between it, at least not yet. By no means am I telling you to not believe time travel is impossible,
but work with the experts and ask other people to confirm your methods work. The power does not come from the
people, it comes from the individual. <em>END OF INTERVIEW</em></p>

<p>Bulstrode then went back to college to study physics at a high level. He is determined to find a way to go back
in time and prove his intelligence. It is strange how a man thought he could turn back time simply by rotating
the hands on a clock, but Bulstrode is creating an inspirational story where he is learning from his mistakes
and improving to one day make the world a better place.</p>

    <title>Greenhouses do not create greenhouse gases</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/05/10/greenhouses-do-not-create-greenhouse-gases.html</link>

    <description>An article about Greenhouses do not create greenhouse gases</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pollution and greenhouse gases are major environmental issues plaguing our planet today. Greenhouse gases include carbon
dioxide, methane, and more. These gases rise up to the atmosphere and create a thicker insulation layer. Radiation from the
sun passes through the atmosphere but then gets trapped in the Earth because of that thicker atmosphere due to greenhouse
gases. The Sun is a very hot object, and the rays it projects into the Earth are also hot. Because these rays are trapped in
the Earth, the Earth gets warmer. This is what is known as global warming. It is called global warming because it is global, or
is happening all throughout the globe.</p>

<p>Locals cannot grasp with the gravity of the seriousness of global warming. Richard Joe states, <em>“With nice hot weather, the
Earth should just take a vacation to the beach, have a nice cool drink of coke and eat some ice-cream.”</em> Locals do not
realize the Earth is not a person but in fact a planet, so they laugh of global warming as a joke. Global warming has the
ability to change ocean currents, melt the icecaps which will not only destory homes for polar bears, seals, penguins, and more
but will also cause rising sea level. Scientists report <em>“no cap”</em> as when you put ice in a glass of water and wait for it
to melt, there will be more water in the cup and scientists say to treat the Earth like a glass of water in this situation
except the water should not increase. If water levels rise, many cities will submerge underwater. Local John Doe says
<em>“I would love for my home to become a beach”</em> but does not realize his entire home will be <em>under</em>water, meaning he will
no longer have a home.</p>

<p>Many people began attributing the rise of greenhouse gases to greenhouses. <em>“Makes sense to me”</em> Joe says, <em>“If they are
called greenhouse gases they must be coming from greenhouses.”</em> However, the similar naming scheme is all but a coincidence,
as greenhouses grow plants, not generate greenhouse gases. Middle school science teachers across the nation affirm plants to
produce oxygen through photosynthesis, a chemical reaction where plants turn water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose.
Scientists have confirmed humans do breathe carbon dioxide and plants do produce oxygen. In fact, plants are reducing
greenhouse gases because of their ability to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen. Greenhouses trap heat inside so the plants
are able to stay warm, and greenhouse gases are called that because they turn the Earth into a greenhouse which traps heat,
not because greenhouses produce these gases. Greenhouses are beneficial for our planet and they are a great way to learn
botany and gardening.</p>

    <title>Cars are faster than walking</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/05/10/cars-are-faster-than-walking.html</link>

    <description>An article about Cars are faster than walking</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have made a revolutionary discovery: commuting in cars are faster than walking.</p>

<p>Locals are schocked at this disocery. Long Man Jones reports <em>“A discovery which will shake the foundations of the world
as we know it.”</em> Others cannot handle the new fact such as Billy Big Bob, who states <em>“This is pure nonsense! There is
no method of transportation faster than walking!”</em></p>

<p>Cars are using a motorized combustion engine which allows them to convert fuel, typically petrol and sometimes electricy,
into movement and have the power of about 120 horses. Some cars on the high end have the power of 400-500 horses! Horses
are very powerful animals who are able to travel at high speeds. This holds true even in the fantasy world in games such
as <em>Minecraft</em> and horses can carry people on top of that! Before the first industrial revolution, horses were a popular
method of transportation, but there was still a huge popularity in walking. In fact, the fastest people in those times were
faster than the fastest horse. These people of the older generation just simply cannot believe there is a faster power of
transportation. If a car has 120 horsepower, it has the power of 120 horses, which are more horses than the amount of friends
most people have.</p>

<p>Humans are able to travel at a rate of 28 mph, meaning they can go a distance of 28 miles within the time of one hour. A
car can travel up to 120 mph and the fastest ones can reach speeds of 200 mph. Mathematicians around the globe have told us
120 is about 4 times as much as 28, and Google even confirms this in their calculator app, which says 120 / 28 = 4.285.
Scientists also note a major difference between cars and humans: humans can continue walking as it uses relatively less energy
while a car must stop at a designated gas station. These “gas stations” pump the car’s fuel from the car and place it into
the car’s fuel tank and charge the owners of the car for it. A human can walk continously at a steady pace while only needing
short breaks for a little water and some food. There continues to be a debate on whether cars or humans are faster.</p>

<p>Scientists have put the nail in the coffin of this debate by stating “the pratical clause.” If you were living a few miles
away from school or work, <em>Google Maps</em> lists cars as taking less time than walking. Although humans can cut through areas
cars cannot because of the size of a human compared to a car, cars are much more practical for longer distances. Most citizens
continue to ignore scientists and continue to believe walking is faster than cars, but scientsits around the world have
proven cars to be faster. Next time you are going somewhere, consider using a car rather than walking.</p>

    <description>An article about Youtube Algorithm fills local Man's feed with Propaganda</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, local citizen Usnavi Komse Foroil reported a strage influx of propaganda with an unkown origin</p>

<p><em>“I was just browsing last night at 3am… Y’know, to catch m’self up on the latest memes. Hand must’ve slipped or something. When I came to nex’ mornin’, my home page started goin’ all ‘Vote Triumvirate, Vote Smart!’ Dunno what caused it, but sure is freaky”</em></p>

<p>-Foroil, when asked about the cause of this mysterious event</p>

<p>We sent the Youtube Propaganda to Hecrenews’s Science and Research team (SAR), and the conclusion was most surprising. The initial assumption was that the propaganda would be communist. Usnavi’s search history (procured with consent) revealed that (among other more questionable things), he often searched for <a href="https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_in_the_Soviet_Union">Russian Propaganda</a>. Given the frequency of communist words in Usnavi’s autofill suggestions, our team tried to test for any instances of left-wing ideals. However, this search disappointingly resulted in only one instance of the word “us”.</p>

<p>With this lack of evidence pointing towards communism, our team of self-proclaimed experts concluded that this propaganda was created by something else entirely. Something bearing no resemblance to the Hecretary Bird vs. Snaxe conflict, or any other recorded schism.</p>

<p>Something new.</p>

<p>This new propaganda most likely appeared on Forsoil’s feed because he clicked on a certain video. Our team is currently working on finding the exact video that would have caused such a recommendation.</p>

<p>The propaganda urged poor weak-minded Usnavi Komse Foroil to “Vote for the [The Triumvirate]”, which he immediately did, despite not knowing who The Triumvirate were and how he could vote for them. The intentions of this “Triumvirate” are currently unknown.</p>

<p>If you, or anybody near you has more information, or have also experienced a sudden surge of Propaganda telling you to vote for three mnystery individuals, call this number IMMEDIATELY:</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What’s popping folks, I will begin a series of writing timed essays (30 min.) from <a href="https://www.misd.net/languageart/grammarinaction/501writingprompts.pdf">this pdf</a>. Let’s just do one and see where it goes!</p>

<p>Keep in mind these are opinion based essays, so there isn’t a right or wrong answer, but you are proving your argument with evidence. Argumentation is a great skill to have so let’s have some fun!</p>

<h1 id="prompt">Prompt</h1>

<p>Many people believe that television violence has a negative effect on society because it promotes violence. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your response.</p>

<h1 id="the-essay">The Essay</h1>

<p>After the second industrial revolution many people had greater access to leisure. Radios, theathers, movies, parks, but television
is one of the most impactful leisure experiences available to us. Television (TV) has many channels one can watch from cartoons to sports
to news and politics, and many people can easily get addicted watching hours of TV per day. Some people believe television to
have a negative impact on society because of its promotion of violence; however, exposure to violence does not result in one
becoming violent and malicious people will tend to be aggressive.</p>

<p>Television has its safety for a younger auidence, but there are many outlets where violence can still be seen. The news is a
primary example of violence explaining wars, shootings, diseases, and a plethora of other mature content. In fact, schools
across the nations encourage students to watch the news to stay up to date, the schools are encouraging students to view
violent content. Despite the exposure to violence, most kids do not end up being violent. If one visits a school, they will
be greeted with typical kids, not especially affected by violence due to TV exposure. Another prime example of exposure to
violence not resulting in violence is video games. There are many video games most would consider to be violent falling into
the hands of a younger audience who are not intended on playing those games; the parents are the ones buying the games for
their kids. Violence in video games does not lead to violence in people; however, many violent people do play violent video
games, so the correlation between the two are typically confused. The same principle applies to TV, a violent person tends to
be violent by nature, not because of exposure to violence.</p>

<p>Violent people will tend to be violent. A personality trait is an intrinsic part of one’s character: changing the trait
requires a great deal of effort and time. A outgoing person tends have a lot of friends, a determined person tends to
achieve what they wish, a smart person tends to do well in school, and a kind person tends to help others. With the same
principal of personality being linked to one’s character, a violent person should tend to be violent. If an introvert was
exposed to an outspoken person with a large circle of friends, it is not likely the introvert will suddenly transform their
character to fit what they were exposed to. Perhaps they may try talking to one or two more new people, but the change will
not be as drastic. If an energetic and robust person was exposed to meditation, perhaps they may try it but they will not
change their personality to being calm and collected. Following the rules of personality, exposure to violence will not
immediately cause one to become wicked.</p>

<p>Most ideas of sources leading to violence are misconceptions, one’s personality is an integral piece of their character and
the drastic change many believe to be true is unrealistic. However, one’s personality is not truly constant: because a change
of character takes a long time does not mean the change is impossible. An emotional event can move someone, the effort to
transform oneself will slowly result in progress. While drastic change is not likely, by comitting oneself to change and
working tenaciously, transformation is possible.</p>

    <title>Datil Discovered</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/05/05/datil-discovered.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/05/05/datil-discovered.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Datil Discovered</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The digital era has long past begun, and it needs energy. Energy comes in all shapes and form. We consider two energy types: renewable, and non-renewable.</p>

<p>Renewable energy is energy which can be replaced quickly. We also consider them to come from natural sources like running water, the wind, the sun.
Renewable energy is what the green thumbs are all about but they rely on nature so they could work inconsistenly. If there is no wind,
you wind turbines will not work. If there is no sun, your solar panels will not work. Although water energy such as dams or water wheels are
less likely to fail due to nature, there is a large portion of energy lost. This dives deep into the physics of it, and we are not going to go there.
Basically, when you convert something into energy, you don’t get 100%, and although renewable energy sources are increasing that conversion rate, they
still can’t beat the non-renewable energies.</p>

<p>Non-renewable energy is energy which is not replaced quickly. Examples include coal, gas, fossil fuels. Non-renewable energy also comes with the
cost of carbon dioxide emmisions which can contribute to global warming, but on the other hand non-renewable energy sources provide more jobs than
renewable energy sources.</p>

<h2 id="but-we-came-here-to-talk-about-datil">But we came here to talk about Datil</h2>

<p>Datil is an energy source that came out of nowhere. The HBA is scrambling to figure out what it is as they believe Datil has fallen into the wrong hands,
someone working with the Snaxii who is speculated to be even more vicious than the Yiper itself. We do not know if Datil is renewable or non-renewable, but
we are certain it is an energy source. Datil is different than all other energy sources because Datil can directly power organisms, whereas the other energy sources only power machines.
With the ability to directly power up living species, Datil has a 100% energy conversion rate. No energy is lost. It is even possible datil is over 100%, in that it does not only convert
all of its energy, but provides more than that. The HBA has gotten their hands on a quantity of Datil and they will be revealing the test results when they are done.</p>

<p>Datil is shrouded in mystery but yet has the power to revolutionize the whole world. Even with that, if it did go into the wrong hands what is the worst to come? The only
evil beings are the Snaxii, and with a combined effort we can reduce the extent of their power. Datil is not a force of good or a force of evil. Datil is a tool which can
help either side achieve its goals. What are your opinons on Datil? Would you convert all of your energy sources to Datil given the choice?</p>

    <title>HBA Book</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/05/04/hba-book.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/05/04/hba-book.html</guid>
    <description>An article about HBA Book</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know the HBA is working on a book?</p>

<p>As usual with the HBA not too much information is known but they have been working on a novel which they are calling an epic since 2018. Although, the HBA stopped working on it during 2019 which is the around the same time the HBA stopped operating, but they are picking it back up in 2020 and are planning to finish it before 2021 although I personally doubt this will happen.</p>

<p>First we need to get some things clear. An epic is typically a very long poem. There are many examples of epics in Greek literature and my favourites are the Iliad and the Odyssey by Homer. While epics typically refer to those poems, oxford has given one definition of an epic which is:</p>

<p>“a long film, book, or other work portraying heroic deeds and adventures or covering an extended period of time.”</p>

<p>So is it a novel or an epic? I doubt the HBA will be able to make something on the grand scale of an epic so it will probably be a novel. The novel in question is under the code name M&amp;M, just like the candies you would eat. I don’t know what’s so epic about some candies, but the HBA claims the book will be a page-turner, a massive success, and a revolutionary book which will change the way people perceive novels and create a new standard or it will become a legendary book out of its league.</p>

<p>How can a book even be so exciting? Movies and T.V. shows are much more easier to consume as reading takes focus and a lot of effort. You need to create a picture in your head whilst a movie will provide you with the picture. Perhaps movies could stifle the imagination, but reading can be arduous. The HBA claims the M&amp;M will be a book which will be able to make people start reading. That is a bold claim because in the times we live in, we have all the content on the internet; however, I am curious about the M&amp;M and I would like to see how it performs in the real world.</p>

<p>What are your opinions on the M&amp;M which the HBA is working on?</p>

    <title>Snaxing Guide</title>
    <link>https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/05/01/snaxing-guide.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://hecrenews.github.io//jekyll/update/2020/05/01/snaxing-guide.html</guid>
    <description>An article about Snaxing Guide</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The definitive guide to snaxing and snaxe safety compiled by the HBA version 1.0 (future versions may never come)</p>

<p><strong>WHAT TO DO IF YOU HAVE A SNAXEBITE</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, you must identify the snaxe. If it is a major snaxe then you must pray that it does not use its time-stalin powers on you. If it isn’t a major snaxe, then proceed to treat it like a normal snaxebite. If the bite is from a major snaxe that has not used its time-stalin powers on you yet, then you are safe, as long as you kee pchanting the mantra: “Hector the hecretary bird halfheartedly hunted the heinous snaxe helper.” Do this eleven and a half times as fast as humanly (or hecretary birdly) possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughly clean the area of bite before moving a muscle. Any movement of an unclean Snaxe bite wound will result in infection. Unfortunately, you hear beats involuntarily, so you will get infected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Move away from any dense, shady areas and go into a clearing or open space. If that is not possible, get to a very high-up place. If that is not possible RUN!!!!!! until you reach a H-Bird/Snaxe research base. If you are lucky, the snaxe will not pursue you because you are too thin to make a good meal. If that is not possible, you are dead. Abandon all hope of surviving and pray to the hecretary birds.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE <ins>AGRESSIVELY</ins> ATTACKED BY A SNAXE</strong></p>

<p>(Snaxe hunts you and then attacks; Snaxe attacks at night)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kick, fight back, and use your fists. Do everything possible to let the Snaxe know you will not be subdued easily.</li>
  <li>If bitten, follow proper snaxebite protocol.</li>
  <li>Use debate, rhetoric and persuasive speech to convince the Snaxe to leave you alone.</li>
  <li>Make the Snaxe tired and lazy.</li>
  <li>Run away if you are not dead.</li>
  <li>Still run away if you are dead.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Start Snaxing!</strong></p>

<p>Okay, that was the HBA’s snaxe safety guide version 1.0, now let’s talk about the actual snaxing!</p>

<p>When the life of a Snaxii ends, they will turn into Shapeless Pulp. Normally you can read this kind of stuff on the Hecrepedia but they haven’t updates in years. The goal of snaxing is to collect all of this shapeless pulp, to defeat the snaxii, or simply to have a fun time.</p>

<p>Make sure you check out the <a href="https://hecrepedia.github.io">Hecrepedia</a> and view all the Snaxii. Version 1.0 of the Hecrepedia included the dangertivity of the Snaxii but the Hecrepedia does not contain that information. The general trend is the more common the Snaxe, the less dangerous it is. I sure hope the HBA updates the Hecrepedia soon.</p>

<p>Now when you snaxe you gotta have the top of the line tools. Here’s what they are.</p>

<h2 id="aqua-salt-defense-mode">Aqua Salt Defense Mode</h2>

<h2 id="snaxe-spray">Snaxe Spray</h2>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/snaxe_spray.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I honestly don’t know too much about these tools, the HBA has not provided enough information for me to give out. I do have an AD for Snaxe Spray which I will tell although we are not sponsored.</p>

<h3 id="buy-our-snaxe-spray"><em>Buy Our Snaxe Spray!!!</em></h3>

<p><em>Our patented spray has infusions of shapeless pulp to ward away any Minor Snaxe!!! It can even destroy cardboard boxes of the Grind Snaxe! Buy our product today!</em></p>

<p><em>May cause small holes in the space-time continuum</em></p>

    <description>An article about HBA Twitter Account Opened</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The HBA has launched a twitter account! For what purpose is unknown.
Are they trying to attract more followers?
Trying to spread propoganda?
These are the deep and insightful questions we will not get the answers to, because the HBA does not reveal their inner workings.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hecretary/status/1252989326524403713?s=20">Here</a> is a link to their first tweet.</p>

    <description>An article about HBA Update</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello peoples! The HBA has been out and about for a while but trust me, they are coming back even better than before.</p>

<p>For those of you who don’t know, the HBA stands for the Hecretary Bird Association. It was founded back in 2016 after the supreme leader became a prophet. The supreme leader saw the Hecretary Bird, he saw the truth. With this knowledge he enlightened his subjects on the true ways of the world and the Association was formed. During its inception the HBA focused mainly on research. They researched Snaxii, Hecretary Birds, and even Other Animals. They dived deep into obscure literature to understand the history of the world and were guided by the hopes of one day seeing the Hecretary Bird or defeating the Evil Snaxe.</p>

<p>The HBA started out small, it only began recruiting select members in 2017. The research was expediated with the extra members and the Association decide to dip its toes into media. Two major projects began concurrently: the play and the epic code named “The M&amp;M”. Both pieces are said to be the greatest works of the modern era, but they have yet to finish. The HBA also began many new books, but most failed as nobody was able to complete any of the books. Unfortunately, the HBA became quite inactive in the years of 2018 and 2019, little progress was made on either of the two major works. The Association was slowly fading away. Fortunately, in late 2019 and 2020, the Association bounced back. The <a href="https://hecrepedia.github.io" target="_blank">Hecrepedia</a> was rebuilt from scratch and became the best it has ever been. The Hecrenews project was revived and you can see the results of it right now!</p>

<p>Fans who have eagerly awaiting the completion of the M&amp;M and the Play were in rage learning about the inactivity of the HBA but they have became excited seeing the HBA bounce back. Both the M&amp;M and the Play are expected to be completed before 2021, and fans are going crazier than ever.</p>

<p>Despite the great news on the completion of these two major works, the Association has not released any information on when their research in continuing. Rumors are going around that a book explaining all the creation will be worked on after the completion of the M&amp;M but none can be too sure.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the HBA is a quite interesting organization and their next move will always keep us excited.</p>
