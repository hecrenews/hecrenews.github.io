    <p>Diligent students are always working throughout the year. Teachers are loading students with assignments so they are ready for
their future.</p>

<p>“Mitochondira is the powerhouse of the cell,” said Gordonpointy Shdon. Shdon has passed many job interviews but keeps on finding
new jobs. “I still haven’t found the one thing I like yet. It’s fun trying out my options, since I have so many.” Shdon is one
of many students who attends school.</p>

<p>School is an educational institution aimed at teaching kids acadmeics, the arts, and mental health to prepare kids for
independent lives as adults. A key factor in many classes is the assigning of homework. “Homework allows students to not only
review the content we went over in class, but master it,” says anonymous teacher. “Usually our next lesson builds up on the
other one. There
is a saying that 10,000 hours are needed to master something. Maybe that’s needed to master a skill, but by completing the
homework, our students are able to master a specific concept which will be vital to the next lesson. Also by focusing the
homework on a specific skill, we can easily identitfy the problem if a student requires aid.”</p>

<p>However, during the summer homework rates are dropping to zero. “It’s called Summer vacation,” says Shdon. “We get a break from
school so we don’t have to do homework.” Teachers are eagerly waiting for the summer pandemic to end, atlhough some report
summer is an annual event, especially science teachers. Summer has a drastic effect on the lives of both teachers and students,
and students especially quite enjoy summer vacation. “I do hope summer goes by fast so I can continue interaction with other
humans like a normal person” Shdon says.</p>
