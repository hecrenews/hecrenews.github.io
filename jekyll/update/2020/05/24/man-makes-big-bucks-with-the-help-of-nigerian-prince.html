    <p>Isaiah Dobrila is a very lucky man. A few days ago Dobrila recieved an email in his inbox from the Prince of Nigeria, a person
with a high position and a lot of authority. The Prince’s wife was in very ill health and the Prince was needing a large sum to
pay for medical expenses. “The grammar in the email was kinda sus along with the sender, but I can forgive them because they are
probably doing their best to speak English.” The situation was quite strange. Apparently the Prince had recently made a large
deposit to a bank in the United States, clocking in at around $100,000,000 USD. Unfortunately, the Prince was having some sort
of trouble accessing his funds (Dobrila is not disclosing the email so we can only go off what he has told us in an interview).
The Prince needed to know Dobrila’s bank account so he could transfer the money. The Prince did not need all the money and was
willing to give Dobrilla 10% of the total amount. Doing the math Dobrila will be making $10,000,000! Dobrila happily gave his
bank account to the Prince as he was saving the life of his wife but there arose a problem.</p>

<p>The Prince was having some trouble accessing the account. He needed Dobrila’s social security number, his driver’s license, and
his credit card number. “It was at this moment I was starting to become a little bit more suspicious,” said Dobrila, “But still,
the Princess of Nigeria is in danger and I am helping to save her life!” Dobrila replied to the Prince’s email the next day
after collecting all his information. “I really hope his wife can be saved,” said Dobrila. “I myself had lost my wife to cancer
a couple of years ago, I know the pain of losing a loved one and I definetely do not want the King to go through the same
experience.” Dobrila’s personal histroy is leaving us in tears, but now comes the moment of truth. The Prince responded saying
it was sucessful but it would take about a week or so to process the information. Dobrila waited eagerly.</p>

<p>Dobrila recieved an email four days later at 3:42 AM. He was happy to see what was in the email. “The Prince’s wife had been
cured, the Prince was so grateful and I almost began crying. I looked in my bank account and there it was, the $10,000,000.”</p>

<p>We then asked Dobrila what he is going to do with the money. “Well, the health care costs are insane. I cannot believe they
charge as much as they do. I’m going to donate all of this money to help reduce the cost of healthcare. I met up with my good
friend Adalbert Bulstrode the other day and he’s doing some crazy science research. He can definetely reduce the cost of
healthcare because he’s crazy smart. It’s weird because he didn’t use to be so smart. He thought he could time travel by
changing the time of the clock but now he’s changing the world.”</p>

change.</p>
