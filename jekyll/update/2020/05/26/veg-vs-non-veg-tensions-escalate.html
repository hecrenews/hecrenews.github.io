  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Clara Dita was walking home from work when she was jumped by a gang of non-vegetarians. They threatened Dita with knives and
stones and stole her purse. Why did they do such a terrible thing? -Because Dita is a vegetarian.</p>

<p>“Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian are not simply choices of our diet, they define us,” said Koppel Burcu in 5000 B.C.E.
colorized. The diet people choose are raising tensions much more than race and religion. Fights are breaking out across the
nation bewteen vegetarians and non-vegetarians, and they cannot be stopped. The police cannot break up the riots, as they
join up with their sides and continue the fight. The government is in disarray, it is worse than pre-south-succession.
Imagine Sumner versus Brooks on a more massive scale. In fact, if you look outside the windows of your house, you might see a
fight breaking out. Even hospitals have identified themselves as vegetarian and non-vegetarian and a vegetarian hospital will
not help a non-vegetarian. One may wonder where vegans and other diets (such as the only milk diet) fit into this but the
truth is no one cares, especially for the vegans. The vegans who refuse to align their views with vegeterians and identify
themselves as vegetarians will be seen as vile as non-vegetarians to vegetarians.</p>

<p>The tensions between the non-vegetarians and the vegetarians are not new. In fact, they have existed for years but were
overshadowed by other contemporary issues. A vegetarian can easily identify a non-vegetarian, and a non-vegetarian can easily
identify a vegetarian, it is an innate ability of humans. Although the root cause is human nature, both sides have still come
up with reasons why they hate the other.</p>

<h2 id="vegetarians-argument">Vegetarians Argument</h2>

<p>Vegetarians believe non-vegetarians to be blood-thirsty human beings whose hunger for meat can never be quenched. Fast-food
chains are rampant across the country, and they are factories for breeding animals just to be fodder. Vegetarians are
symphathetic to these animals as they believe it is unfair for an animal to be born with the sole purpose of its life being
to be killed and then consumed, and it is worse for factories. The other important argument vegetarians make is the dominance
of the human species. Plants are very powerful beings, and if humans are not keeping them in check, plants can go out of
control. The other herbivores won’t have as much as an effect as humans. Trees will grow everywhere, plants will break
through the concrete. Although many believe plants and humans to have a symbiotic relationship of sorts, vegetarians are
fearful for the power plants can have if they are being kept in check. “Just look at the wild jungles of the world, it is
practically impossible to live there,” said Mynte Pauli. “Plants destroyed the homes of so many of my loved ones, we need to
strike back.” Of course there is more to the argument, but the boss does not pay me enough to investigate further.</p>

<h2 id="non-vegetarian-argument">Non-vegetarian Argument</h2>

<p>Non-vegetarians believe vegetarians to be a joke, they are just superior to vegetarians. Humans have evolved to be capable of
eating plants and animals. If humans continue to not eat animals, all the arduous years of evolution would have been in vain.
“If I worked a trillion hours on a project,” says Baldwin Abolfazl, “I would want the audience/client [he said the slash] to
use all of it. I wouldn’t want them to only use one thing and make the other part weaker. It’s like exercising. You gotta
exercise the whole body, you can’t just exercise your arms or else your legs will remain sticks.” “Is that a personal attack,”
I asked Abolfazl. “Also, if you need to work all of your muscles, shouldn’t you be eating vegetables too? The same argument
you made can be used against you if you don’t eat vegetables.” “I would never eat veggies,” said Abolfazl, “That would make
me a [strong language] vegetarian, and I can’t lose my reputation like that.”</p>

<p>So the two sides have hated each other for a very long time, but how did tensions exactly escalate? Take a gander at the
following graph:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/exponential.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The tensions are exponentially increasing. This data was given to me by Wopps Minor, and with Wopps Minor being a member of
the Hecrenews, you can trust its credibility.</p>

<p>Fights are breaking out more and more. This is becoming the new normal. Peace does not seem like an option any more. Protect
yourselves. To quote the ancient proverb: “Hide yo kids and hide yo wives!” We recommened not enaging in the violence but
still lock your windows, barricade your doors. When you see a fight run. If you seek help from either side, they will make
you fight for them. The times are becoming more and more dangerous. We asked Adalbert Bulstrode for his expert opinion but he
currently has no solution. His science team has been broken up due to internal schism over diet, and he is unable to create
a solution without their help.</p>

<p>Although, hope is always there, and as long as one has hope, one has not lost.</p>
