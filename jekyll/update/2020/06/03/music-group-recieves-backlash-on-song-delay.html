    <p>A brand new music group, ARMD, has already brought itself into a deep pool of controversy.</p>

<p>In actuality, ARMD is not a new music group, they simply have not released a new track. In this day and age something being
new is very fast. If it’s past a month it’s hard to call it new, pop culture doesn’t work the same way as science. Fans of
ARMD were eagerly awaiting the first track, it was speculated to be “the most epic and fire track ever heard” (said a local
fan of ARMD). ARMD has a <a href="https://armdmusic.github.io">website</a>, a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-330378554">soundcloud</a>, and
a <a href="https://twitter.com/ArmdMusic">twitter</a>. Most have been barren an empty until ARMD recently posted a tweet on their
twitter. ARMD has pushed back the release date of their first track to February 31st. Fans have lost it. ARMD has kept on
pushing back and pushing back the release date of their first track. The final push has caused fans to go past their boiling
point.</p>

<p>“We promise it will be fire,” says a member of ARMD during an exclusive interview. “We want this first track to be something
really special, it’s going to stand the test of time and everyone should be able to relate to it. We want to change the world
with our music. Many people believe music can’t do much, but if you create something really amazing, you can move people to a
cause.” The members of ARMD are scrambling to get their act together so they can release their first track. If they fail to
meet the February 31st timeline, they will probably fall under.</p>

<p>We asked ARMD how exactly they are going to make their track, and luckily they did answer us. “So first we were just chatting
during lunch ya know? We were just messing around talking about some random stuff and suddenly we just had an idea, it just
popped into our head! Next we just opened up a google doc and started writing some lyrics. So we made a chorus, that’s the
repeating thing, and then we just starting writing down some words. Now that we have that situated, we started working on the
beats. The beats are actually the hardest thing for us and we are still working on them. There are so many different sounds
to choose from and our sound guy doesn’t know who to write melodies.”</p>

<p>Finally, ARMD revealed the reason of their major delay. “We actually lost of one our members recently. No, not like that, he
just left the group. I mean, it’s not that he left we kinda forced him in and he never joined, so idk. Now we got a new guy
in and we kinda need to rewrite the lyrics.”</p>

<p>We are hoping ARMD is able to finally deliver on their promises. Subscribe to them on SoundCloud in case they do ever drop
their track (we are sponsored but they aren’t paying us, boss isn’t paying me much either).</p>
