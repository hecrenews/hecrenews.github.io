    <p>Nikša Cole discovered something very important today: the internet still exists.</p>

<p>Many people have long forgotten about the internet, it is a relic of the past when computers needed entire rooms and couldn’t fit on one desk. To really understand
the findings of Cole, we must first understand what the internet is. Inter means to place a corpse in a grave or tomb and net is a meshed bag. Hold up, this just in
form the Hecrenews English and Reading Team (EAR) that is not correct. Apparently inter is short for interconnected, which basically just means connected, and net is
short for network. An interconnected network of computers, but what exactly is a computer?</p>

<p>Most people believe computers are the laptops or the desktops which run Windows and do many stuff. Some people call them PC for Windows OS and Mac for Apple’s OSX
despite a PC just being short for personal computer not related to the operating system. However, the Hecrenews Technology Investigation Core and the Hecrenews
Technology Analysis Core (TIC TAC) have really dived deep into the history and mystery of computers to help me write a compelling article the boss will approve of
as well as Hecrenews Article Quality Control (HAC). A computer is simply something that calculates things, it ‘computes’ stuff. Our brains are calculators, and animal
brains are probably some of the earliest ones. Abacuses are also computers. For those of you hip modern e-kids playing all that Fortnite and don’t know about good ‘ol
books, vhs, here is a picture of an abacus (My homie Kawolski from the Pengiuns of Madagascar can be seen using it):</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/abacus_stock_photo.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>However, most locals believed I was crazy when I interviewed when I asked if they though an abacus was a calculator. 69% reported to not know what an abacus, 26.8%
reported “No,” and 4.20% reported “Gone and solid gone.” These days we can just consider a computer to be something with a processor. A phone, a microwave, your car,
all of these are valid computers. Now we basically know the jist of what a computer is, so we can get popping into this internet stuff.</p>

<p>A computer can connect to another computer, and this process can get real complicated real fast. There are a bunch of big bad, tall mean lean and green servers all
around the world, and a server is just another kind of computer. Many locals call this the ‘cloud’ despite the cloud being the delicious fluffy things in the sky
(article on that coming soon <em>hint hint wink wink nudge nudge</em>). Anywho, these servers are connected through various methods, one of them are the fiber optic cables
that run along the ocean floor which allows us to link up with the homies overseas. These big servers are connected to a bunch of smaller servers and some of these
are manages by your ISP and run into your house! In your very own house you can set up a local area network (LAN) and connect devices to other devices in that (LAN)
network, which is pretty cool.</p>

<p>But all this techno mumbo jumbo makes no sense, so let’s talk about something that does. The internet is place where introverts and extroverts alike go, read news
(I recommend the Hecrenews, great news site), read books, play games, do school. Our lives have gotten really dependent on the interet, and Cole’s discovery of the
internet still existing is very important to our human infrastructure. The internet is not an obsolete item of the past, it is real and it is now. Cole just hopped
onto twitter to check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/hecrenews">Hecrenew’s twitter account</a> and had a realization the internet was still there.</p>

<p>The internet has everything, if you have a device and an internet connection you can learn anything. If you are reading this, you already have both! Freelancing,
business, coding, marketing, etc., the possibilities are endless! This is just a reminder giving you guys hope the HBA is always there for you.</p>
