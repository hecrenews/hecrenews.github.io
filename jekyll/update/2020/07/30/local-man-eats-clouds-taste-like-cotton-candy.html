    <p>As children we all wonder, “what does a cloud taste like?” There are so many clouds in the sky, but most of us want to take a nice big bite out of cumulus or
cumulonimbus clouds. While I would love to include all the cloud types and pictures to artifically include article length but that’s just too much effort (uh oh,
I have a feeling HAC’s not gonna like that). It’s so nice, big, warm, fluffy, soft, and delicious, but has anyone actually every tasted one of these magnificent
<em>things</em>? Matthia Lucilla is the man with a plan who was set on tasting a cloud.</p>

<p>Matthia Lucilla first saw a cloud at the age of 7, believe it or not (you better believe, we are the most reliable news source in the Hecresphere). Seeing the clouds
changed his life, he immediately began learning all he could about clouds. Soon elementary school teachers had nothing to teach Lucilla as he already knew the nuances
between stratus, cirrus, cumulus, stratocumulus, cirrostratus, cirrocumulus, nimbostratus, altostratus, altocumulus, and cumlonimbus clouds! That’s a mouthful, good
thing I paid attention in elementary school and memorized those, I certainly did not search those up on Google… Lucilla was the cloud man, and became a powerful
force in his school because of his knowledge of clouds. Lucilla was getting all the girls despite not being the fastest runner in the grader (a total shock and shift
of the power system, revolutionizing elementary school dating life as we know it), however, if Lucilla truly wanted power, he would start an underground school
organization like <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/27/billa-the-rise-and-fall-of-an-undergound-school-organization.html">Billa</a>, Lucilla was just
a boy with a dream and a love of clouds.</p>

<p>As Lucilla got older he still wanted to know more, he craved the cloud knowledge and would spend most of his free time just gazing at clouds. When he was called in for
lunch he realized he never knew what a cloud tasted like. He started staying after school in his chemistry class trying to make clouds and played around with water,
the condensation and perspiration ting (as mentioned by my man Big Shaq himself) but he wanted to taste that natural cloud. Upon consulting literal genius Adalbert
Bulstrode (no relation to the fame-gaining Bert Bulstrode (once spelt Bullstrode)) Lucilla realized he could not (sadly) climb up to the clouds, the base of the ladder
would be too unstable and that’s not even considering wind, air pressure, and UFOs. Lucilla was stumped.</p>

<p>Lucilla kept on going to school and consuming that knowledge, he became #1 in his class and scored a 100 in everything: by mastering all the subjects he could learn
and know more about clouds, his one passion in life. It his Lucilla in geography class, he had to climb a mountain. If he got to a high enough altitude, he would be
able to soak himself in the cloud. He could not only eat the cloud, but be in the clouds essence, become the cloud if you will. Lucilla just needed to find a mountain.
Lucilla decided to choose mount Himalaya, as the legendary man Shri Ballaji was said to meditate there for years upon years.</p>

<p>After spending two years learning how to climb mountains, Lucilla was finally ready to climb, and he was already an expert. In only one day’s time, he saw his dream,
his life. He was inside a cloud. Lucilla took a deep breath, and the air was the cleanest and freshest air he had ever breathed. He was ready for the moment he had
been waiting for his entire life, he took a large bite of the cloud. “It was delicious,” he said, “I am now satisfied with my life, anyone could be after tasting
that.” Lucilla had just achieved his dream of eating a cloud. Unfortunately Lucilla was unable to build his dream home there because of the high altitude but he was
happy for what he good, the most critical moment of his life.</p>

<p>Lucilla is now a meterologist working somewhere but surely the HBA will recruit a talent like him soon so guess we’ll be seeing him again. Anyone can achieve their
dreams if they believe and work hard like Lucilla, at Hecrenews we report the big stories of big mans, in hopes that one day you too can become a big man. Chase after
your dreams and don’t regret not chasing them.</p>
