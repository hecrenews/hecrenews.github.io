    <p>Úlfur Svetlana had to go to something he annually dreaded, the Doctor’s Appointment. All throughout his life he has been told the doctors are just normal people
vibing and fixing you up (although they cannot fix your emotions if you are a teen pretending to be depressed). Svetlana had an innate fear of doctors. The same way
people were afraid of bugs, spiders, clowns, Svetlana was afraid of doctors. Instead of recieving the emotional support from people around him, he was ridiculed for
being scared of the doctor. Every family member, friend, and even bystanders and strangers would start roasting him for cowering in fear when he had to visit the
doctor. Dentist was no problem, eye doctor all good, it was just the standard doctor giving him problems.</p>

<p>Svetlana was once again cowering in fear in his closet. Soon his family would have to drag him out of there as they go for a combined check-up, and Svetlana had no
choice but to go, no matter how strong his phobia was. For Svetlana, going to the doctor was like getting a shot from the doctor. Speaking of which, the injections
were another subject Svetlana feared a lot. He wasn’t a skrub and knew the vaccines would (and have) saved his life a numerous amount of times but the thought of a
needle poking into his skin and then a foreign substance entering his body did more than simply send shivers down his spine. However, for this particular visist,
Svetlana had brought with him a secret weapon. For a couple of years he started delving into botany. Not only did Svetlana have a successful vegetable garden (which
he then taught local schools how to make), but he also had a fruit garden. There was one fruit in particular Svetlana was cultivating, and this fruit would serve as
his ultimate counter against his fated enemy. You guessed it (I hope you did), Svetlana was growing apples.</p>

<p>As the addage goes, “An apple a day keeps the doctor away.” Doctors may be Svetlana’s greatest fear, but he knows the counter. Doctors, for some strange reason
(Science and the Hecrenews Science and Research (SAR) are unable to figure out) doctors cannot stand apples. And not meaning they will sit down in the precense of an
apple, doctors will run for their lives if they notice an apple in the near vicinity. SAR encourages individuals, especially young and learning kids, to test out the
experiment for themselves. While my article quality is not good enough to have images like
<a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/20/writing-in-all-caps-found-to-be-more-persuasive.html">Wopp’s great example</a>, SAR has provided the instruction to
run the experiment and it’s not that hard. Use one day as a control. Do not bring anything sus, meaning any type of food, to the doctor, and see what happens. Then
switch up the type of food you bring. This is called an independent variable, it is what the experimenter can change and is what the dependent variable (which is the
doctor’s reaction) relies on. After getting your control and recording your observations, try bringing in a vegetable and then a fruit other than an apple. Finally,
bring an apple and see what happens. For extra flavor, try bringing in a tomato, which experts cannot determine if it’s a fruit or a vegetable, and see what happens.
That’s all from the SAR today.</p>

<p>Anywho, Svetlana went into the room waiting for the doctor to come. The doctor soon came in, asking “How are you today” and had an assortment of needles and syringes
and other scary stuff with him. Svetlana was going crazy on the inside due to his fear, but on the outside (the real world) he calmly took the apple out of his pocket.
The doctor wasn’t looking at the apple at first but once he saw the apple, he immediately broke into a cold sweat. The doctor’s breathing changed, becoming heavier
and faster. Goosebumps rose all over. The doctor tried to run but fainted before reaching the door and the doctor had to be sent to the hospital. Svetlana survived
the doctor visit this time, but will he be so lucky the next? He sure is getting it from his family. Anywho, this has been Mister Mjir popping in and now popping out.</p>
