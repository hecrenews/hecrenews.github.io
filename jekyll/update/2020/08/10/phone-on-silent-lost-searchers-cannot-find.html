    <p>Sung-Min Saško was at a meeting for work on day and decided to turn his phone on silent, or do not disturb. While we do not understand the specifics of what the
 mode is actually called, we do know that it prevented the phone from vibrating or making any kind of sound. Saško made a lot of strong points during the meeting
 and his co-wokers say he carried the meeting and is soon going to carry the company. “He’s gonna become a big man and perhaps a big boss too while he’s at it” says
 Raja Bharat, a member of the sales team. However, Saško made one vital mistake. Saško lost his phone, and now there was no way to find it.</p>

<p>Saško did not realize he had lost his phone until he reached home. When he finally came home he wanted to chat with his girlfriend and that’s when he realized his
 phone was not in the correct pocket. Saško searched through his pockets, his bags, his drawers, his cabinets, between the sofa cushions, on the floor, anywhere a
 phone could be but he could not find it. Saško assumed he had just left it at his office so he went to sleep feeling a little bit more relaxed, knowing his phone was
 in a safe place. He could not call it because it was on silent and the GPS tracking would not work because his phone did not come pre-packaged with GPS, he had to
 install it himself but he was too lazy to do so and did not install the quintessential amenity.</p>

<p>When Saško returned to work next day he checked his cubicle. It wasn’t a big place but after rummaging through all his drawers for about 10 min. he was unable to find
 it. He asked his boss if he had left his phone at the meeting but his boss did not see anything. Saško was starting to become more anxious. He had suffered the same fate as a certain <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/06/woman-without-phone-unable-to-call-anyone.html">Elisaveta Eógan</a> did two months prior. He did not know where his phone was now and he was probably having a bunch of missed calls from his girlfriend, 100% not a good thing for Saško, he was going to get it when she finally returned from her overseas work. The boss decided to offer a helping hand to Saško and called over law enforcement to devise a search and rescue opeartion for the phone. Saško thought that this was too much but the boss assured him this was proper, it had happened once before when he too was a corporate slave not living the high life.</p>

<p>The Phone Search and Rescue Squad (PS) arrived shortly onto the scene and began questioning the boss and then Saško. Soon they began question the other employees at
 Saško’s company and no one was suspected of lying and no one noticed anyting about the phone. The PS said there were two possibilites: a simple phone theif (which was
 pretty rare these days) or the phone was in it’s rebellious phase and ran away (much more common and is dealt with a lot by the PS). The PS asked for photos of the
 phone but unfortunately those photos were in the phone which ran away, Saško did not havae any on hand but at least he knew the model and make of his phone, so the PS
 could know what it looks like.</p>

<p>The PS began hanging missing posters all around the local town but have not recieved any notice of it. They are still performing an official professional search and
 rescue operation but they are still looking for a lead. The PS is a welcoming organization willing to help anyone with their search and rescue needs. Anything from
 missing phones to missing nerf darts to tv remotes, these guys got you covered. I guess we will hear more from there later, this was Mister Mjir, poping in and now
 popping out.</p>
