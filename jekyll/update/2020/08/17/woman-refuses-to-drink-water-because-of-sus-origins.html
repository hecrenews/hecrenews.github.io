    <p>Anneliese Verginia has caused local storm for refusing to drink water due to “mad sus origins” as one neighbor put it. People across the nation drink water without
thinking too much about it. Some are slightly more cautious than other and buy purified water or a filter for their tap water. Some make sure only to but the top-notch
bottled water infused with rich minerals and energizing electrolytes. However, Verginia is too suspicious of her water and to understand why one must go quite a while
back. It all started in 3rd grade.</p>

<p>Before being midway into 3rs grade Verginia was like most people and did not pay much attention to her water. She knew it was necessary to survive but did not have
the insight of an older person knowing about water sources such as ground water, lakes, treatment plants, and the water companies that send the water to you.
Verginia was actually more healthy than most people drinking water throughout the day and always drinking at least 6-8 cups. Combined with a diet full of fruits and
veggies, the future was looking bright for Verginia. However, one day in science class her teacher began teaching the students about the water cycle. This is the cycle
in which water is renewed and reused. Most of the water in the planet is reused, and rarely do we get an increase via foreign entities such as asteroids.</p>

<p>A water cycle is not a type of bike; however, you can think of the water cycle as the wheels on a bike, as it keeps on going round and round. If you’ve never heard of
the water cycle or need a quick refresher, here is a handy-dandy image to fill you in on all the details:</p>

<p><img src="https://hecrenews.github.io/assets/images/water_cycle.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So you have collection, which isn’t included in this image but instead percolation. Percolation is the movement of water through the soil into a ground water source.
Collection is a process in the water cycle where water is, you guessed it, collected! Ever seen a lake or a pond, maybe an ocean? Those are all examples of collection.
The water will eventually come down there but let’s talk about the next steps and come back to collection. There is also evaporation. Evaporation is when the water
gets real hot and the energy added changes its state of mater into a gas, now it’s water vapor, and it flies into the sky like an airplane. A step that is similar to
evaportaion is transpiration, but the main difference is transpiration comes from flora, or plants. Plants are living things too, and they require water to survive.
The main way plants get water is by sucking it from the ground with their roots, and transpiration is when the water gets removed from the plant and goes into the sky.
Next up we have condensation. Once you get to the high altitudes it gets pretty cold, and you’ve seen the mountains with snow on their tops I’m sure (or you can
quickly search it up). The water vapor gets less excited and the water molecules begin coming closer together and create clouds. We can spend a long time talking about
clouds but I’m sure <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/30/local-man-eats-clouds-taste-like-cotton-candy.html">Matthia Lucilla</a> can tell you a lot more.
After enough condensation a cloud gets too heavy and also pretty dark so it has to release its water. The water can come in various forms of your favorite states of
matter. You can get liquid rain, solid hail, or crystaline snow. Sometimes you even get thunder and lightning into the mix but thats a topic for another day. The
precipitation falls and guess where it ends up? In a collection of water! And thus the water cycle repeats itself.</p>

<p>So why is Verginia refusing to drink water? It’s all because the teacher exposed a fun fact, something he should not have done in the precense of the cautious
Verginia. “Did you know that we could be drinking the same water as the dinosaurs did?” said Verginia’s science teacher. And this is when Verginia began to doubt
everything she knew about the world. Eventually she calmed down and only began doubting water but the amount of doubt she had for water was still at an alarming
level. “If the dinosaurs drank it, who else has been involved with the water? And did I even mention the water travels through the digestive system and also gets
recycled through that? Gross! This water is way too sus to drink,” said Verginia during out interview.</p>

<p>The neighbors are constantly trying to push Verginia to start drinking water again but to no avail. For now they can only keep on trying. Verginia has survived so
far by first freezing her water to turn it into solid ice, then boiling it for a good amount of time (and collecting the vapor so nothing is wasted). Then she has
her own set of chemicals and filtration systems to ensure her water is purified to the maximum, she cannot trust anyone else with purifying water because you don’t
know where it could be.</p>

<p>I hope the SAR (Hecrenews Science and Research) approves of this article. This has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>
