    <p>Trains go chug-a-chug-a-chug-a-chug-a-chug-a-choo-choo! Trains are an iconic symbol of human industrialization, the growth of human techonology and the ability to
better tap into and harness our imaginations. The early pioneers of trains spent back-breakign hours under the sweltering sun and dangerous conditions to lay down some
tracks, if only they were able to also drop some bars then we would have some fire ‘classical’ music. Trains can help with transportation, but one particular train
has achieved a milestone of ruining traffic all around.</p>

<p>“Was just driving in me car,” said a local man, whoops, I forgot to take his name. You’ll have to trust me on this interview. “See I was about to go forward, I bought
the <a href="https://hecrenews.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/09/man-invents-device-that-turns-traffic-light-from-red-to-green.html">magic device which turns the signal</a> and
I was just waiting for the connection to stabilize so that the signal would magically turn green. It finally turned green and I was ready and raring to go but the railroad crossing stopped me in my tracks! Guess I’ll have to get a refund.” The train stopped a couple of cars from passing but the traffic chaos did not stop there.</p>

<p>This train also blocked the traffic of 7 ships passing by. “How in the world did the train even start going on the water?” said the captain of one of the ships. The
train was just cruising along the water like it did in the Polar Express but on water instead of ice. Usually most people do not care about water traffic, but in the
recent years transporation by water has gotten increasingly popular and many people, upper class, middle class, and lower class have been riding on boats to experience
the joys and wonders of the seven seas (although scientists at our very own SAR say there are more than seven seas). This was already a wild ride but the passengers
of the train were so engrossed in their smartphones they did not notice what was happening now or what was happening next.</p>

<p>The train began flying. Not only was it going to stop the traffic on earth and water, it would also reach the air. Several planes had to stop midflight (they stayed in
suspension of course) because of the train. The plane passengers were really annoyed because they were really getting into that plane flow. Several helicopters also
had to stop because of the train flying. The train’s passengers did not notice anything but serveral plane passengers noticed. Some believed they were going crazy
and some updated their snapchat stories, one woman even got a streak of 17 years after that photo. Afterwards, the train continued back on the tracks and the passengers
safely and quickly reached their destination.</p>

<p>“This is my favourite train, always super fast and super reliable,” said one of the passengers. I was about to ask the conductor for an interview but he dipped as he
had to go to the next stop. Trains are truly magnificent, and maybe soon this train will interrupt fire traffic, then interrupting traffic of all four elements.
Until then, this has been Mister Mjir, popping in and now popping out.</p>
