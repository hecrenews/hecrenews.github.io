    <p>Sten Gabriel lives in a cold place. Not as cold as Antartica but the summers are like the winters they teach in school and winters are ferocious. Gabriel is not even
an adult, but he has created great change in community. A handful of people die every year due to the very cold winters of where Gabriel is from and Gabriel wanted to
stop that. Although only a teen, he had a special skill which adults just couldn’t do as well as him. Gabriel was an up and coming pro gamer.</p>

<p>People across the nation treat gaming as a second, most of the times even lower than that, citizen. The media says gaming causes violence, most people say it’s a waste
of time, and most of the time gaming falls on the politcally incorrect side of the spectrum. However, studies have proven violence to be the major cause of violence,
not gaming: a violent person is more likely to do violent things and play violent games, the game itself is not a major factor in causing one to be noticably more
violent than they were. In addition, many people spend all their lives honing a game or sport, but these people get more respect as they have to train their bodies
and have physical strength to show for their passion. Gaming just doesn’t have noticable ‘real-world’ benefits. Some kids were able to do things like protect their
siblings from wild animals or drive a car to safety when the driver passes out and credit those to video games, but the media always shift attention to the next big
issue (of course we at the Hecrenews cover all that’s important in the Hecresphere).</p>

<p>Gabriel discovered something. It was not revolutionary, and in fact many people face the problem but just do not give it that much importance. When doing intense
gaming, Gabriel’s computer begins to heaten up. The internals of the computer are so hot it would be able to cook an egg and easily give a person a burn. Then Gabriel
connected the dots. People in his community were dying due to the intense winter, and Gabriel’s hobby can mitigate this problem or counteract it. Gabriel began going
to work. His school was closed due to the huge blizzard at the time so Gabriel had to research on his own. He had multiple textbooks and plenty of articles to help
him. After reading a bit in chemistry and physics, Gabriel began learning about electrons and after reading some articles he learned the conduction and flow of
electrons.</p>

<p>Now after gathering some materials, Gabriel was able to hook up his computer to a heater, and now was able to see the results of his experiment. Gabriel played some
heavy, high-power usage games on his computer and after a few minutes the temperature in his house increase by a wopping 10 degrees (not minor though)! Gabriel shared
his experiment with the others in his community, and soon all the children began hooking up their computers to their central heating unit and in the recent years,
not a single person has died in Gabriel’s community due to the cold weather. He became a hero in his community and we are here to document his story.</p>

<p>While the common person reading this article may believe it’s impossible to reach the levels of stoicism as Gabriel, he just followed a few simple steps. He identified
a problem, observed, researched, and implemented a solution. However, for most people there are a few more steps involved: make errors and repeat. Sometimes a solution
will not work the first time, that is a mistake. One must then identify what went wrong during that experiment and make adjustments to correct that mistake. But
with perseverance, anyone is able to solve any problem they encounter and make their world a better place to live in.</p>

<p>Also we are continuing to make a lot of spicy updates to the Hecrenews, we just added more features for our author sections, check it out if you get time, and more
updates are coming. We are gonna release our roadmap sometime in the future so you can see how Hecrenews is getting updated.This was Mister Mjir, popping in and now
popping out.</p>
