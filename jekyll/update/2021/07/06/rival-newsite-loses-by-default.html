    <p>Hello hello, it’s ya boi Mister Mjir popping in for another one. Yes it’s been a while but things at out Hecrenews branch have been quite busy, so I didn’t get time
to really dig down deep into a story and produce an article about it. Anyways, here’s the scoop.</p>

<p>You may remember we were dealing with a rival newsite problem. Unlike many other fake news site and news companies that spam ads and clickbait articles, this newsite
was legit, and of the same caliber. Welp, no point in beating around the bush, let’s cut to the chase. <a href="https://melnewzers.blogspot.com/">MELnewzers</a> is the rival
newsite we were dealing with. We already had spies infiltrating their ranks- I think Wopps knows more if he wants to do a follow up article -and we were keeping them
at bay. MEL stands for Motivation, Energy, and Life, or something along those lines, I don’t really know as the information is not easily accessible. These guys
were pumping out motivational articles about famous people, and life tips and tricks to help you succeed. Is this really news? Who knows, but it’s 100% MEL. This
site was doing so well, so what went wrong?</p>

<p>I suspect their to be a simple cause. Notice in the current day, the left sidebar on the MELnewzers site says the ominous acronym, “VEC.” I have seen so many
acronyms throughout my time I don’t even know if I have storage for any more. The handy-dandy sidebar indicates VEC means volunteering and education. These don’t
follow typical HBA acronym naming guidelines, as none of the letters of the acronym in the full name are capitalized. Since there are no parenthesis we can assume
there are no implied letters, there is one “v” so that’s capitalized. The “e” is tricky, I personally think you can’t choose between the two “e”s in volunteering,
as they are right next to each other, so I will take the liberty of assuming the “e” in education is the 2nd letter in VEC. The C has to come after that e, and there
is a c in education and club, and I really can’t figure out what is what. Below the VEC icon it says VEC Club, in which case club is not part of the acronym, but the
blurb indicates VEC means volnteering and education club. Does VEC mean “volunteering and education” club or “volunteering and education club” club? I am so bamboozled.
I’m gonna go with Volunteering EduCation Club, let us know what you guys think in the comments below, we do read all of them! Digging into VEC a little more, it turns
out VEC has their own website and social media accounts. I’ll leave the further digging to you, loyal Hecrenews reader. It looks like VEC has purchased or acquired
MELnewzers in one way or another, and MELnewzers has stopped posting articles/blogs since, maybe. Idk tbh.</p>

<p>MELnewzers hasn’t posted since February 16th, 2021, promising one or two posts weekly starting the week after said week. This has not happened. What has VEC done to
MELnewzers? Who knows, but what we do know with the lack of articles is that MELnewzers is no longer a Hecrenews competitor, which is why we are finally revealing the
name to our rival news site. The only thing I can really say is this is mad sus, and I’ve seen a lot of strange things in my time. It should further be noted, that the
articles by Wopps featuring the notorious Monkey Beater have been posted on the MELnewzers blog, but currently are not available, they must have been shutting Monkey
Beater down (which is good, no qualms with that). Winning by default is not the most exhilirating thing, but I think it captures the spirit of our team the most.</p>

<p>Well it looks like this is the time for me the wrap up this article. When is the next article coming out? I have no clue. What I do know is this has been Mister Mjir,
popping in and now popping out!</p>
